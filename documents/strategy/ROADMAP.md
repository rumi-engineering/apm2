# Master Roadmap

This document links the 5-phase [North Star Vision](NORTH_STAR.md) to specific implementation milestones, PRDs, and transition gates.

## Phase 1: Recursive Self-Improvement (Current)
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Primary Focus:** Automating the core software factory loop.

| Milestone | PRD / RFC | Transition Gate (Exit Criteria) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| **Autonomous Kernel** | `PRD-0001` | Single-command end-to-end execution of a verified change. |
| **Cousin Prevention** | `PRD-0004` | 100% of new requirements map to CCP before implementation. |
| **Council Protocol** | `RFC-XXXX` | Multi-agent quorum reaches convergence on 3 consecutive PRDs. |
| **Recursive Skill Edit**| `rsi-modes-of-reasoning` | Agent successfully refactors its own reasoning documentation. |

---

## Phase 2: Novel Methods Generation
**Status:** PLANNED
**Primary Focus:** Agents generating algorithmic and architectural innovations.

| Milestone | PRD / RFC | Transition Gate (Exit Criteria) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| **Scholar Integration** | `RFC-XXXX` | Agent can perform prior art search against patent/academic DBs. |
| **Novelty Discriminator**| `RFC-XXXX` | Automatic scoring of "semantic distance" from existing methods. |
| **First Patentable Method**| `RFC-XXXX` | Agent generates a method with >2x performance vs. baseline. |

---

## Phase 3: Company Formation
**Status:** CONCEPTUAL
**Primary Focus:** Monetization and organizational substrate.

| Milestone | BP / PRD | Transition Gate (Exit Criteria) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| **IP Ledger** | `BP-0001` | Immutable record of agent-authored IP with ownership proof. |
| **Licensing Engine** | `BP-0002` | Automated royalty collection and contract enforcement. |
| **First $1M ARR** | `BP-0003` | Verifiable revenue from external software licenses. |

---

## Phase 4: Corporate Partnerships
**Status:** CONCEPTUAL
**Primary Focus:** Scale and planetary distribution.

| Milestone | PRD / RFC | Transition Gate (Exit Criteria) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| **Multi-Tenancy** | `PRD-XXXX` | Secure isolation of partner data and IP within the holarchy. |
| **Federated Factory** | `PRD-XXXX` | Secure coordination across organizational boundaries. |

---

## Phase 5: Planetary Impact
**Status:** TERMINAL MISSION
**Primary Focus:** Life sciences and the alleviation of suffering.

| Milestone | PRD / RFC | Transition Gate (Exit Criteria) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| **Bio-Holon Kernel** | `PRD-XXXX` | Extension of the factory to laboratory automation and modeling. |
| **Disease Target #1** | `PRD-XXXX` | Successful identification of novel therapeutic target. |
