Traditional operations (SRE, DevOps, ITIL) assumes human operators and static infrastructure. This RFC must define what operations looks like when both the operators and the operated-upon are autonomous agents in a holarchy. Incident response becomes a protocol, not a runbook. SLAs become machine-checkable predicates, not contractual prose. Revenue is evidence-bound, not self-reported. The frontier here is active-inference-based anomaly detection, formal incident containment protocols, and operational survivability under Byzantine conditions.\n\n## Priority innovation vectors\n\n- **Active inference for monitoring**: use the free energy principle to define 'normal' as a generative model prediction, with anomalies as prediction errors that trigger containment before diagnosis.\n- **Formal incident containment**: incident response as a typed protocol with containment-first triage \u2014 bound the blast radius before you understand the cause.\n- **SLA as proof obligation**: machine-checkable SLA predicates evaluated against evidence under HTF time authority, not wall-clock approximations.\n- **Revenue as evidence**: business value claims bound to AAT-BIZ verification receipts \u2014 the system doesn't just report revenue, it proves it.\n- **Operational survivability under partition**: define safe degradation modes when cells lose connectivity, including which operations continue, which pause, and which fail-closed.\n\n## Problem (PHY-03, PHY-04, INV-F-15)\n\nThe system must eventually generate revenue (BSP_01: value requires state transformation; BSP_04: physical cost floors are non-zero). RFC-0021 VPHI defines the Venture Proving Holon with AAT-BIZ verification and strategy coupling to MSC-03/MSC-05/MSC-06. RFC-0019 FAC v0 automates admission. RFC-0018 HEF provides the event fabric. RFC-0017 defines daemon-as-control-plane.\n\nBut there is no normative protocol for deploying a live service, monitoring it, responding to incidents, enforcing SLAs, collecting revenue evidence, or managing the service lifecycle. The system can build and verify code; it cannot operate a production service. This RFC closes the gap between \"code passes FAC\" and \"customers are using it and paying.\"\n\n## What already exists\n\n| Artifact | Provides | Gap |\n|---|---|---|\n| RFC-0019 FAC v0 | Automated admission (ingestion -> review -> receipt -> projection) | Admits code, doesn't deploy or operate it |\n| RFC-0021 VPHI | Venture proving with business verification | Verifies strategy claims, doesn't run services |\n| RFC-0018 HEF | Pulse plane for event routing | Carries events, doesn't define operational events |\n| RFC-0017 Daemon | Control plane with capability-minted episodes | Controls episodes, doesn't manage long-running services |\n| apm2d_runtime_v1.proto Process Management | ListProcesses, Start/Stop/Restart/Reload | Manages daemon processes, not deployed services |\n| BSP_01-BSP_04 | Physics-of-value axioms | Axioms without operational protocol |\n| HSI \u00a711 Business Continuity | RPO/RTO targets, backup/restore, chaos drills | Defined for the platform itself, not for services the platform operates |\n\n## Machine-checkable objectives\n\n**OBJ-ASO-01**: Deployment is receipt-gated: No service deployment without a FAC admission receipt AND a VPHI strategy-alignment receipt. Services deployed without both are S0 defects.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 deployment: \u2203 fac_receipt \u2227 \u2203 vphi_receipt: both.valid = true`\n\n**OBJ-ASO-02**: Health is continuously attested: Every running service must produce health attestations at a configurable interval. Missing attestation triggers incident protocol within one interval.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 service \u2208 RUNNING: health_attestation present per interval`\n\n**OBJ-ASO-03**: Incident response is autonomous and bounded: The system must detect, diagnose, and either remediate or escalate incidents within a declared SLO. Remediation actions are logged as evidence.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 incident: (remediated \u2228 escalated) within incident_slo`\n\n**OBJ-ASO-04**: Revenue events are evidence-grade: Every revenue-generating transaction must produce a ReceiptV1 with the transaction details, bound to the service's deployment receipt and the VPHI strategy coupling.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 revenue_event: \u2203 receipt: receipt.links = {deployment_receipt, vphi_receipt}`\n\n**OBJ-ASO-05**: SLA is a contract object: Every deployed service must have a machine-readable SLA. SLA violations are DefectRecords, not soft alerts.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 service: \u2203 sla \u2208 ServiceLevelAgreementV1 \u2227 violation \u2192 DefectRecord`\n\n**OBJ-ASO-06**: Rollback is always available: Every service deployment must maintain a rollback target. Rollback to the previous known-good version must complete within the deployment SLO.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 deployment: \u2203 rollback_target \u2227 rollback_latency \u2264 deployment_slo`\n\n**OBJ-ASO-07**: Cost attribution is per-service: Every resource consumed by a service must be attributed to that service's budget (from RFC-0024 ResourceBudgetV1). Services exceeding their budget trigger the exhaustion policy.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 resource \u2208 consumed: \u2203 service: resource.attributed_to = service.id`\n\n## Protocol objects (seed schemas)\n\nThese are starting points \u2014 refine, extend, or restructure as your analysis requires.\n\n```\nServiceManifestV1 {\n    service_id: CasDigest,\n    name: str,\n    version: SemVer,\n    deployment_artifact: CasDigest,\n    fac_admission_receipt: CasDigest,\n    vphi_alignment_receipt: CasDigest,\n    instruction_spec_refs: Vec<CasDigest>,\n    sla: ServiceLevelAgreementV1,\n    resource_budget: ResourceBudgetV1,\n    rollback_target: Option<CasDigest>,\n    health_check: HealthCheckSpecV1,\n    created_at: TimeEnvelopeRef,\n    principal_seal: AuthoritySealV1,\n}\n\nServiceLevelAgreementV1 {\n    availability_target: Quantity,\n    latency_p99: Quantity,\n    error_rate_ceiling: Quantity,\n    data_durability: Quantity,\n    measurement_window: Duration,\n    violation_severity: Severity,\n    goodhart_surface: str,\n}\n\nDeploymentReceiptV1 {\n    manifest_digest: CasDigest,\n    target_holon: HolonIdV1,\n    deployed_at: TimeEnvelopeRef,\n    deployment_evidence: Vec<CasDigest>,\n    previous_deployment: Option<CasDigest>,\n    deployer_seal: AuthoritySealV1,\n}\n\nHealthAttestationV1 {\n    service_id: CasDigest,\n    holon_id: HolonIdV1,\n    epoch: TimeEnvelopeRef,\n    status: ServiceStatus,\n    metrics: ServiceMetricsV1,\n    sla_compliance: SlaComplianceV1,\n    attestation_seal: AuthoritySealV1,\n}\n\nServiceStatus { DEPLOYING | RUNNING | DEGRADED | DOWN | ROLLING_BACK | TERMINATED }\n\nIncidentRecordV1 {\n    incident_id: CasDigest,\n    service_id: CasDigest,\n    detected_at: TimeEnvelopeRef,\n    detection_method: str,\n    severity: Severity,\n    diagnosis: DiagnosisV1,\n    remediation_actions: Vec<RemediationActionV1>,\n    resolution: IncidentResolution,\n    resolved_at: Option<TimeEnvelopeRef>,\n    defect_record: CasDigest,\n    evidence_chain: Vec<CasDigest>,\n}\n\nRevenueEventV1 {\n    service_id: CasDigest,\n    transaction_id: str,\n    amount: Quantity,\n    customer_id_hash: CasDigest,\n    occurred_at: TimeEnvelopeRef,\n    deployment_receipt: CasDigest,\n    vphi_coupling: CasDigest,\n    receipt: ReceiptV1,\n}\n\nRemediationActionV1 {\n    action_type: RemediationType,\n    executed_at: TimeEnvelopeRef,\n    result: RemediationResult,\n    evidence: CasDigest,\n    autonomy_level_required: AutonomyLevel,\n}\n```\n\n## Trust boundaries and threat model\n\nTrust boundary: Deployed services run in provisioned holons (RFC-0024). The monitoring and incident response system runs in a SEPARATE holon from the service \u2014 you do not let the patient diagnose themselves (LAW-08, verifier economics). Revenue events must be attested by the service AND independently verifiable by the monitoring holon.\n\nThreats:\n1. **False health attestation (PHY-05)**: Service reports healthy when degraded. Mitigation: independent health probing from monitoring holon, not self-report only.\n2. **SLA gaming (AEP_07)**: Metrics are optimized to pass SLA checks without actual quality. Mitigation: goodhart_surface declaration on every SLA; multi-signal health (not single metric).\n3. **Revenue fabrication (PHY-05)**: Service claims revenue that didn't occur. Mitigation: revenue events require external payment processor confirmation; double-entry evidence.\n4. **Incident suppression (PHY-05)**: System auto-remediates and hides incidents from principal. Mitigation: all incidents produce DefectRecords in the append-only ledger; sovereign audit (RFC-0022) can discover them.\n5. **Deployment of unverified code (INV-F-02)**: Code deployed without FAC admission. Mitigation: OBJ-ASO-01 \u2014 dual receipt gate.\n\n## Theory bindings\n\n- LAW-01 (Loop Closure): Service lifecycle is a loop (deploy -> monitor -> incident -> remediate -> re-verify -> operate)\n- LAW-08 (Verifier Economics): Monitoring holon is economically independent of the service it monitors\n- LAW-14 (Proportionality): Incident response is proportional to severity\n- LAW-15 (Measurement Integrity): Health metrics have declared measurement contracts\n- INV-F-02 (No transition without gate receipt): Deployment requires FAC + VPHI receipts\n- INV-F-09 (Budgets mandatory): Every service has resource and cost budgets\n- INV-F-14 (containment > verification > liveness): Service liveness never overrides containment; a service that violates containment is terminated, not kept alive\n- INV-F-15 (Authoritative promotion requires terminal verifier): Revenue claims require terminal verification\n\n## Rollout\n\n- S0: ServiceManifestV1 and DeploymentReceiptV1 \u2014 structured deployment with receipt\n- S1: HealthAttestationV1 \u2014 basic health checking with attestation\n- S2: SLA contracts \u2014 machine-readable SLA with violation -> DefectRecord\n- S3: Incident detection and autonomous remediation (restart, rollback)\n- S4: RevenueEventV1 \u2014 revenue tracking with evidence-grade receipts\n- S5: Full autonomous service lifecycle \u2014 deploy, monitor, remediate, scale, retire\n- S6: Multi-service orchestration \u2014 dependency management between services\n- S7: Cost optimization \u2014 budget-aware placement and scaling decisions\n",
