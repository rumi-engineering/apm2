  risks:
    - id: "RSK-0001"
      title: "Attention policy miscalibration"
      severity: "HIGH"

      impact: "Receipt fanout and verification compute saturation causing liveness collapse"
      mitigation:
        - "compute share ceilings"
        - "fanout amplification limits"
        - "anti-entropy boundedness proofs"

    - id: "RSK-0007"

      severity: "HIGH"
      impact: "Irreversible exposure of strategic mechanisms and privacy-sensitive operating patterns"
      mitigation:
        - "trade-secret-only gate enforcement"

  open_questions:
    - id: "Q-0001"
      question: "Should VentureSignalPublished be a mandatory kernel event in v1 or deferred to v2?"
      why_it_matters: "Affects provenance observability and reducer complexity"
      proposed_resolution: "Prototype both; choose based on replay/audit ergonomics"

    - id: "Q-0002"
      question: "What is the minimum AAT-BIZ hypothesis set for Tier1 vs Tier2+?"
      why_it_matters: "Controls verification cost and false confidence risk"
      proposed_resolution: "Tier1 min=2, Tier2+ min=3 with required countermetric category"

    - id: "Q-0003"
      question: "How should venture signal expected-value priors be calibrated over time?"
      why_it_matters: "Determines attention allocation quality"
      proposed_resolution: "Bayesian prior updates from replay outcomes"
    - id: "Q-0004"
      question: "What control strategy best keeps verification_compute_share <= 0.45 at zettabyte-scale replay envelopes?"
      why_it_matters: "Directly constrains admissibility of scale-envelope operation"
      proposed_resolution: "Run bounded A/B policy simulations with anti-entropy and receipt fanout knobs"
    - id: "Q-0005"
      question: "Which minimal external disclosure channel classes are admissible under trade-secret-only posture without increasing strategic leakage risk?"
      why_it_matters: "Determines operational communication boundaries while preserving strict confidentiality controls"
      proposed_resolution: "Define deny-by-default channel taxonomy and admit classes only with security council signoff and replay-tested controls"
