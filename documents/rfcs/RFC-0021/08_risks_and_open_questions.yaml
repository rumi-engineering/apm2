  risks:
    - id: "RSK-0001"
      title: "Attention policy miscalibration"
      severity: "HIGH"
      impact: "Over-escalation harms throughput; under-escalation harms safety/correctness"

    - id: "RSK-0002"
      title: "Business evidence privacy leakage"
      severity: "HIGH"
      impact: "Sensitive user/commercial data exposure"
      mitigation:
        - "classification + redaction gates"

    - id: "RSK-0005"
      title: "HTF authority drift or wall-clock fallback"
      severity: "HIGH"
      impact: "Temporal trust break leading to stale or unauthorized gate outcomes"
      mitigation:
        - "strict HTF authority validation"

        - "automatic deny on missing boundary artifacts"

    - id: "RSK-0006"
      title: "Verifier-economics overload at scale"
      severity: "HIGH"
      impact: "Receipt fanout and verification compute saturation causing liveness collapse"
      mitigation:
        - "compute share ceilings"
        - "fanout amplification limits"
        - "anti-entropy boundedness proofs"

  open_questions:
    - id: "Q-0001"
      question: "Should VentureSignalPublished be a mandatory kernel event in v1 or deferred to v2?"
      why_it_matters: "Affects provenance observability and reducer complexity"
      proposed_resolution: "Prototype both; choose based on replay/audit ergonomics"

    - id: "Q-0002"
      question: "What is the minimum AAT-BIZ hypothesis set for Tier1 vs Tier2+?"
      why_it_matters: "Controls verification cost and false confidence risk"
      proposed_resolution: "Tier1 min=2, Tier2+ min=3 with required countermetric category"

    - id: "Q-0003"
      question: "How should venture signal expected-value priors be calibrated over time?"
      why_it_matters: "Determines attention allocation quality"
      proposed_resolution: "Bayesian prior updates from replay outcomes"
    - id: "Q-0004"
      question: "What control strategy best keeps verification_compute_share <= 0.45 at zettabyte-scale replay envelopes?"
      why_it_matters: "Directly constrains admissibility of scale-envelope operation"
