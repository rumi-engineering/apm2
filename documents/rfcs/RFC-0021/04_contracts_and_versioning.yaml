  versioning_rules:
    - id: "VER-0001"
      statement: "Schema versions are semantic and monotonic; major changes require explicit migration strategy."
    - id: "VER-0002"
      statement: "Signed payloads must use deterministic canonicalization; map key order and repeated field sort order are normative."
    - id: "VER-0003"
      statement: "Domain separation must include artifact kind and schema version for all signatures."
    - id: "VER-0004"
      statement: "Normative time fields must bind to HTF boundary IDs and signed authority clocks; wall-clock fields are display-only."
    - id: "VER-0005"
      statement: "Dominance-order evaluation semantics are part of contract truth and cannot be overridden by lower-precedence predicate outcomes."
