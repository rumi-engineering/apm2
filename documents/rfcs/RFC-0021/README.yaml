    RFC-0021 specifies the Venture Proving Holon Interface (VPHI): a parallel,
    bounded subsystem that tests APM2 end-to-end by having a holon attempt to
    build a profitable software company and emit machine-verifiable signals.

    VPHI introduces a three-source intake model bound to Forge Admission Cycle (FAC):
    - DEFECT: evidence-backed failures from venture operation,
    - INTENT: feature requests/opportunities from venture operation,
    - DRIFT: non-failure regressions in dependencies, model behavior, policy, or economics.

    The RFC defines signal schemas, attention routing, FAC integration, and a
    strategic AAT extension (AAT-BIZ) so business-domain feedback becomes
    replayable gate evidence rather than narrative guidance.
