      title: "Adopt three-source strategic intake"
      statement: "VPHI intake is DEFECT + INTENT + DRIFT; two-source intake is insufficient."
      context: |
        Defects and feature intents capture only failure and opportunity events.
        Drift captures pre-failure degradation in model behavior, policy freshness,
        economics, and runtime quality.
      alternatives:
        - id: "ALT-0001"
          name: "Two-source intake (Defect + Intent)"
          pros:

            - "Misses non-failure drift and slow-burn regressions"
        - id: "ALT-0002"
          name: "Three-source intake (Defect + Intent + Drift)"
          pros:
            - "Improved early detection and prevention"
            - "Better alignment with LAW-09 freshness and LAW-08 anti-gaming"
          cons:
            - "More schema and routing policy complexity"

      title: "Keep FAC as sole promotion authority"
      statement: "VPHI may open/rank work but cannot bypass FAC promotion gates."
      context: |
        Parallel venture validation must not create a second authority plane for code promotion.
      alternatives:

          pros: ["Preserves existing security/correctness invariants"]

      title: "Introduce AAT-BIZ for strategy-critical work"
      statement: "Stage-5 verification for selected work requires business-hypothesis replay and countermetric checks."
      context: |
        Existing AAT verifies technical validity; strategy-critical changes need additional
        business-domain falsifiability and anti-gaming validation.
      alternatives:
        - id: "ALT-0001"
          name: "No strategic verifier"
          pros: ["No additional gate runtime cost"]

      title: "Deterministic attention routing with upward-on-ambiguity"
      statement: "SIAR routing policy is deterministic; ambiguity or stale policy routes to higher scrutiny tiers."
      context: |
        Routing ambiguity can be exploited to under-scrutinize high-risk work.
      alternatives:

      title: "Reuse kernel events, add minimal extensions"
      statement: "Reuse existing FAC/Work/Defect events; add only targeted event/schema extensions for VPH provenance."
      context: |
        Reusing existing event substrate reduces migration cost and keeps anti-entropy semantics stable.

      title: "Mandate claim-specific strategy coupling for MSC-03, MSC-05, and MSC-06"
      statement: "Tier2+ venture signals require explicit mapping to MSC-03/MSC-05/MSC-06 with claim-specific AAT-BIZ obligations."
      context: |
        Strategy coupling that only names MSC-06 leaves verifier-compounding and oracle-compilation
        loops under-specified. Coupling must be explicit per claim to avoid narrative-only linkage.
      alternatives:
        - id: "ALT-0001"

      title: "Make dominance order and HTF time authority executable gate semantics"
      statement: "Gate truth is computed with strict dominance order and HTF authority; wall-clock is display-only."
      context: |
        If dominance precedence or time authority remain prose-only, conflicting evaluator implementations
        can admit unsafe promotions or stale artifacts.
      alternatives:
        - id: "ALT-0001"
          name: "Narrative-only precedence and time guidance"

      title: "Engineer for exabyte-to-zettabyte scale via bounded verifier economics"
      statement: "Scale is handled by digest-first contracts, bounded anti-entropy, and explicit verifier-economics ceilings."
      context: |
        At global scale, verification and receipt fanout dominate cost and liveness risk.
        Scale assumptions must be surfaced as machine-checkable controls.
      alternatives:
        - id: "ALT-0001"
          name: "Implicit scale handling"
          pros: ["Lower short-term complexity"]
