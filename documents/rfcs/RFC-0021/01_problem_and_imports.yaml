      APM2 has strong FAC and SDLC governance but lacks a dedicated, machine-checkable
      subsystem that continuously converts real venture operation signals into verified
      system-improvement work.

      This RFC introduces Venture Proving Holon Interface (VPHI) to provide that missing loop
      while preserving existing FAC authority boundaries.

      - "Direct VPH merge authority"
      - "Replacement of FAC promotion semantics"
      - "Unbounded growth optimization without countermetrics"
