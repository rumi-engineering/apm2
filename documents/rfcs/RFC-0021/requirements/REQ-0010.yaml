  title: "Strategy coupling exporter for MSC-03/MSC-05/MSC-06"
  category: "FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    VPHI MUST export machine-checkable summary artifacts that link venture outcomes to strategy
    claims and business counters for MSC-03, MSC-05, and MSC-06.
  rationale: |
    Strategic loop closure requires direct evidence linkage from venture signals to strategy gates.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Exporter emits claim-linked summary artifacts for MSC-03, MSC-05, and MSC-06"
    - "Each exported objective includes baseline, quantitative target, HTF boundary ID, owner locus, predicate, and evidence path"
    - "AAT-BIZ coupling ledger maps signal classes to Stage-5 obligations and promotion outcomes"
    - "Artifacts satisfy strategy predicate schemas"
    - "Missing linkage is surfaced as a defect"
