  title: "Kernel event provenance extension for venture defects"
  category: "INTEGRATION"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    The kernel event model MUST support explicit provenance for venture-origin defect emissions,
    either via DefectSource enum extension or equivalent authenticated event envelope metadata.
  rationale: |
    Provenance clarity is required for routing policy, audit, and strategic attribution.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Venture-origin defects are distinguishable from other defect sources"
    - "Existing reducers remain backward-compatible"
    - "Replay semantics remain deterministic"
