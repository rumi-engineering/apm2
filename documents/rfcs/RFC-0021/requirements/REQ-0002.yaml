  title: "Deterministic attention scoring and tier routing"
  category: "FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    SIAR MUST compute attention tiers deterministically from typed signal inputs and
    signed policy bundles. Equivalent inputs MUST produce equivalent route outputs.
  rationale: |
    Non-deterministic routing undermines replayability and enables hidden policy drift.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Identical input bundles produce identical attention_tier and route_type"
    - "Policy version/hash is captured in AttentionDecisionReceiptV1"
    - "Routing decisions are replayable from persisted artifacts"
