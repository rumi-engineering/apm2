  title: "Attention anti-downgrade invariant"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Attention routing MUST enforce anti-downgrade semantics: risk/uncertainty ambiguity can only
    preserve or increase scrutiny tier unless an explicit waiver with required authority is present.
  rationale: |
    Downgrade attacks can silently route high-risk work through weak gates.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Ambiguous signals route upward"
    - "Unauthorized tier downgrades are rejected"
    - "Authorized waivers are explicit, signed, and time-bounded"
