  schema_version: "2026-02-05"
  id: "REQ-0001"
  title: "VentureSignalBundleV1 schema and signature validation"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    The system MUST validate VentureSignalBundleV1 artifacts for schema integrity,
    signature validity, freshness/time-envelope admissibility, and evidence-manifest
    resolvability before any routing or work admission.
  rationale: |
    Venture signals are untrusted by default. Admission without full validation permits
    forgery, replay, and policy bypass.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Invalid signature fails ingestion"
    - "Invalid/expired time envelope fails ingestion"
    - "Missing evidence artifact hash fails ingestion"
    - "Validation outcomes are receipt-backed and auditable"
  evidence_ids: ["EVID-0001"]
