  title: "Trade-secret-only IP posture and patent-filing denial"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    VPHI MUST enforce a trade-secret-only protection posture. Patent, provisional,
    or equivalent external IP filing workflows are prohibited and MUST fail closed
    for admission and promotion. Any external disclosure channel not explicitly
    classified as confidential and policy-authorized MUST be denied.
  rationale: |
    Public IP filings and uncontrolled disclosure channels expand the attack surface
    and can irreversibly expose strategic mechanisms, customer-sensitive patterns,
    and verifier internals.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Patent or provisional filing attempts are blocked and logged as security defects"
    - "Tier2+ promotion is denied when IP posture evidence is missing, stale, or ambiguous"
    - "Unapproved external disclosure artifacts are rejected before work admission"
    - "Trade-secret policy snapshot hash is bound to gate receipts"
