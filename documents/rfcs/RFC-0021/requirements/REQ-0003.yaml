  title: "AttentionDecisionReceiptV1 emission and CAS binding"
  category: "FUNCTIONAL"

    Routing must be an auditable fact, not an implicit runtime side effect.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Receipt exists for each accepted signal"
    - "Receipt signature verifies under policy-authorized identity"
    - "Work metadata contains receipt hash linkage"
