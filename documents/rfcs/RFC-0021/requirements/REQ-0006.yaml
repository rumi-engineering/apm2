  title: "Mandatory AAT-BIZ enforcement for required work classes"
  category: "VERIFICATION"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    For work classes marked AAT-BIZ-required by policy, promotion MUST fail closed unless
    a valid AAT-BIZ receipt is present and all required predicates pass.
  rationale: |
    Prevents strategy-critical work from bypassing business-domain verification.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Required paths without AAT-BIZ receipt are blocked"
    - "Receipt present but failing predicates blocks promotion"
    - "Tier2+ bypass count remains zero"
