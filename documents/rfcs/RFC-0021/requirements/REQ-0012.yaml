  title: "Scale-envelope verifier-economics and anti-entropy controls"
  category: "PERFORMANCE"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    VPHI MUST remain admissible at multi-exabyte to zettabyte evidence scale by
    enforcing digest-first contracts, bounded anti-entropy behavior, tiered retention
    manifests, and verifier-economics ceilings for compute share and receipt fanout.
  rationale: |
    At global scale, verification work and fanout costs become primary failure modes;
    implicit scale assumptions are unsafe and non-auditable.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Anti-entropy boundedness proofs are present for required synchronization paths"
    - "Verification compute share and receipt fanout remain within policy ceilings"
    - "Tiered retention manifests preserve replay-equivalence integrity"
    - "Unknown scale-control state is fail-closed for promotion paths"
