  title: "Dominance-order and HTF time-authority gate evaluation"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    VPHI gate truth MUST be evaluated with strict dominance precedence
    containment/security > verification/correctness > liveness/progress and
    MUST use HTF boundary authority for normative time truth. Wall-clock
    timestamps are display-only and cannot authorize gate outcomes.
  rationale: |
    Prose-only precedence or wall-clock gate truth permits inconsistent policy
    execution and stale-admission bypasses.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Evaluator enforces strict precedence ordering for every gate result"
    - "Missing or invalid HTF boundary artifacts produce deny outcomes"
    - "Wall-clock-only artifacts are rejected for gate truth"
    - "Unknown or parse-error states fail closed"
