  title: "PolicyResolvedForChangeSet Precondition"
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    SpawnEpisode and work orchestration MUST verify that a
    PolicyResolvedForChangeSet event exists for the target change set before
    issuing capabilities or spawning execution.

  rationale: |
    Governance policy resolution is the authoritative gate for work execution.
    Enforcing this precondition prevents unauthorized or policy-divergent work.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - id: AC-DCP-0002-001
      description: "SpawnEpisode requires PolicyResolvedForChangeSet."
      verification: "UT-SPAWN-001 + INT-002 validate rejection without policy resolution."
    - id: AC-DCP-0002-002
      description: "ClaimWork issues capabilities only after policy resolution."
      verification: "INT-001 validates capability minting after governance decision."
