requirement:
  id: REQ-DCP-0003
  title: "GateLeaseIssued Precondition"
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    Gate executor spawn and gate outcomes MUST require a valid GateLeaseIssued
    event bound to the intended custody domain and change set.

  rationale: |
    Lease gating prevents unauthorized gate execution and enforces custody
    separation between authoring and reviewing roles.
