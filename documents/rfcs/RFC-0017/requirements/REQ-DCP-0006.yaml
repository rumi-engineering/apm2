  id: REQ-DCP-0006
  title: "SoD Custody Domain Enforcement"
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    Gate executor spawn MUST enforce Separation of Duties (SoD) by rejecting
    custody-domain overlap between authoring and reviewing roles.

  rationale: |
    SoD prevents a single actor from both authoring and approving changes,
    reducing the risk of insider manipulation.
