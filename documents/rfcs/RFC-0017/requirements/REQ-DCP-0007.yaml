  id: REQ-DCP-0007
  title: "Signed State Transitions"
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    All state transition events MUST be Ed25519 signed with domain-separated
    prefixes, using canonical event bytes as the signing authority.

  rationale: |
    Domain-separated signatures prevent replay across event types and make
    event authenticity verifiable at ingestion.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - id: AC-DCP-0007-001
      description: "Unsigned events are rejected on ingestion."
      verification: "ADV-007 rejects unsigned receipt."
    - id: AC-DCP-0007-002
      description: "Signature verification rejects invalid signatures."
      verification: "UT-SIGN-002 covers invalid signature rejection."
