  title: "Automated FAC v0: End-to-end ingestion, review episode, durable receipt, GitHub projection"
  summary: |
    This RFC specifies the remaining integration work to reach automated FAC v0 where:
    1. A PR/changeset is ingested into CAS+ledger
    2. A reviewer episode runs with bounded tools over an isolated workspace
    3. Review artifacts are stored durably in CAS and anchored by ledger events
    4. A projection worker posts results to GitHub as output only

    RFC-0019 builds on RFC-0018 (HEF/FAC v0 primitives) and addresses the missing
    daemon control-plane wiring: session viability, workspace apply, tool log capture,
    episode event persistence, and projection worker integration.

    RFC-0019 also makes receipts holon-ready (ViewCommitment + ContextPack bindings),
    and defines an adapter profile contract for running heterogeneous agent CLIs under
    kernel-side tool execution.
