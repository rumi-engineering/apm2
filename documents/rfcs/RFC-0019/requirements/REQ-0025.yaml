  title: "RequestTool cutover: handler becomes thin wrapper over AdmissionKernel plan/execute"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    The RequestTool handler MUST be refactored to a thin wrapper over AdmissionKernel
    plan/execute API with no direct broker/effect calls remaining.

    The handler MUST only own: bounded decode, transport/session plumbing, observability
    (metrics/logging), and translation between protocol structs and kernel request structs.

    All authority-bearing side effects (tool/broker calls, mutations, outbound boundary
    crossings, declassification emissions, quarantine insertions) MUST route through
    AdmissionKernel.

    For fail-closed tiers, no effect output (including streaming partials) MUST be released
    before post-effect boundary checks complete.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00494.
  rationale: |
    RequestTool is the primary effect-capable endpoint. Until it routes through
    AdmissionKernel, the no-bypass rule is incomplete and admission decisions are
    scattered across handler code.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "RequestTool handler contains no direct broker/effect invocations."
    - "All authority consumption flows through AdmissionKernel plan/execute."
    - "Fail-closed tiers buffer output until post-effect boundary checks complete."
    - "Tests prove no-bypass for RequestTool endpoint."
