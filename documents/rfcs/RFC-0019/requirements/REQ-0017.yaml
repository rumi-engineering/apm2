  title: "RoleSpec v2 contract for WorkObject implementor execution"
  category: "FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    FAC MUST define and enforce a WorkObject-oriented RoleSpec profile (`fac_workobject_implementor_v2`)
    that is hash-addressed, canonicalized, and validated before authoritative execution.

    The RoleSpec contract MUST encode explicit deny taxonomy for missing/stale/unknown/unverifiable
    authority context and require declared tool budgets, allowlists, and output schema contracts.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00446.
  rationale: |
    WorkObject execution cannot remain instruction-text driven; role authority and behavior
    must be machine-verifiable and replayable from hash-addressed policy artifacts.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "RoleSpec profile exists as deterministic canonical artifact addressable by role_spec_hash."
    - "Conformance checks reject missing budgets, missing output schema, and missing deny taxonomy fields."
    - "RoleSpec deny taxonomy is exercised by negative-path tests for stale/missing/unknown authority states."
    - "RoleSpec selection is policy-bound rather than ambient prompt selection."
