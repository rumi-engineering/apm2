  title: "Promotion-critical CAC traceability overlay matrix"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    RFC-0019 chapter 18 MUST define a promotion-critical CAC traceability overlay matrix
    binding TRC-FAC claims to schema contracts, digest-set completeness, canonicalizer tuples,
    and Tier2+ fail-closed trigger semantics.

    Overlay rows MUST remain coherent with RFC-0028 security and RFC-0029 efficiency CAC contracts.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00440.
  rationale: |
    Promotion-critical claims need explicit machine-checkable CAC bindings to avoid prose-only
    traceability that can drift across RFC boundaries.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Chapter 18 includes explicit overlay rows for promotion-critical TRC claims with CAC contract fields."
    - "Each overlay row binds schema contracts, digest sets, canonicalizer tuple, and fail-closed trigger semantics."
    - "Tier2+ unresolved ambiguity is explicitly non-promotable with bounded escalation behavior."
    - "Cross-RFC coherence checks cover RFC-0028/0029 CAC gate and predicate surfaces."
