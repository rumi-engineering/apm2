  title: "Cutover PublishEvidence and EmitEvent to AdmissionKernel with PCAC lifecycle and bundle binding"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    PublishEvidence and EmitEvent handlers MUST be cutover to route through
    AdmissionKernel plan/execute API, enforcing the full PCAC lifecycle
    (join -> revalidate -> consume -> effect) and binding all authoritative
    outcomes to AdmissionBundleDigest.

    These endpoints MUST NOT bypass AdmissionKernel in authoritative mode.

    Policy-root trust prerequisites MUST be enforced: fail-closed tiers MUST deny
    when governance policy root is missing or unverifiable.

    Lifecycle + evidence closure MUST be enforced and tested for these endpoints.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00498.
  rationale: |
    Incremental rollout (§1.3 of ch19) requires that ALL effect-capable endpoints
    in authoritative mode route through AdmissionKernel or be explicitly disabled/
    fail-closed. PublishEvidence and EmitEvent are effect-capable and must comply.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "PublishEvidence and EmitEvent do not bypass kernel in authoritative mode."
    - "Full PCAC lifecycle (join -> revalidate -> consume -> effect) is enforced."
    - "Receipts reference AdmissionBundleDigest."
    - "Fail-closed tiers deny on missing governance policy root."
