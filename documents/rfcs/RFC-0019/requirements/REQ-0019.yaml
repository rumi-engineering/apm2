  title: "Production WorkObject role binding and end-to-end fail-closed validation"
  category: "RELIABILITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    WorkObject execution paths MUST select implementor role profiles in production wiring,
    record role/context hash lineage in receipts, and pass end-to-end adversarial validation
    for missing bindings, stale authority state, and optional-gate bypass attempts.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00448.
  rationale: |
    RoleSpec correctness is not proven by schema validation alone; production dispatcher wiring
    and side-effect path validation are required to prevent silent bypass.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Production dispatch path records role_spec_hash and context digests in authoritative receipts/events."
    - "End-to-end tests validate fail-closed behavior for missing/stale/ambiguous context and authority inputs."
    - "No optional-gate bypass path remains in authoritative WorkObject execution."
    - "Replay-oriented tests confirm deterministic reconstruction of role-bound execution lineage."
