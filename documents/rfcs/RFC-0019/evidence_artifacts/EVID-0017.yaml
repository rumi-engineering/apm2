    Evidence that the Admission Spine v1.1 composition contract addendum exists with normative
    statements, phase ordering, no-bypass rules, and that all required requirement/evidence
    artifact stubs are created for subsequent implementation tickets.

        Admission Spine v1.1 addendum defining:
        - §0: Motivation and goals/non-goals
        - §1: Normative imports, terminology (32 terms), threat model (14 categories),
          compatibility/versioning/migration rules
        - §2: Trust stack (ledger integrity below PCAC, policy-root derivation,
          as_of_ledger_anchor semantics, anti-rollback anchoring)
        - §3: Canonical authority lifecycle (request identity, crash-consistency,
          plan/execute split)
        - §4: AuthorityJoinInput completeness (spine join extension, witness binding
          with seed-at-join + evidence-post-effect, waivers)
        - §5: Composition contract (kernel requirement, capability-gated no-bypass,
          fixed phase ordering A–Q, streaming/output rule)
        - §6: Declassification receipt consumption model
        - §7: Quarantine containment (saturation-safe, priority-aware eviction,
          per-session isolation, durable reservation, restart-safe persistence)
        - §8: Admission evidence bundle (digest-cycle avoidance, bundle content,
          confidentiality + bounds)
        - §9: Conformance tests (CI-blocking invariants)
        - Appendix A: Kernel-facing interfaces (ValidatedLedgerStateV1,
          LedgerTrustVerifier, AntiRollbackAnchor, PolicyRootStateV1,
          PolicyRootResolver, WitnessProvider, BoundaryMediator, AdmissionKernel)
