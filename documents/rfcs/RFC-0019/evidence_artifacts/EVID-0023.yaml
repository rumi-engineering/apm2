  title: "Ledger trust stack: RootTrustBundle, trusted seals, checkpoint-bounded startup, PolicyRootResolver"
  category: "CODE_AND_TEST"
  status: "STUB"
  description: |
    Evidence that the ledger trust stack is implemented with RootTrustBundle loading,
    trusted seal/checkpoint mechanism, checkpoint-bounded startup validation,
    LedgerTrustVerifier, governance-derived PolicyRootResolver, fork/divergence
    detection, and crypto-agile key rotation/revocation semantics.
