  title: "Production role/context lineage fail-closed evidence"
  category: "INTEGRATION_TEST_RESULT"
  status: "COMPLETE"
  description: |
    Evidence that production WorkObject spawn paths fail closed for
    role/context ambiguity and lineage breaks, while admitting valid
    deterministic lineage.

    Coverage includes:
    - ambiguous role profile hash mismatch denial,
    - stale context recipe hash mismatch denial,
    - missing lineage hash-chain denial.
    - umbrella launch rollout linkage from claim/spawn/session to
      authoritative receipts and projection surfaces.

        `tck_00437_rolespec_vnext_spawn_fails_closed_on_role_context_ambiguity`

        with deterministic derivation.

        bindings through session start, authoritative receipt payload hashes,
        and admissible auditor/orchestrator projections.
