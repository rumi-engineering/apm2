  title: "Spine conformance suite: CI-blocking invariant tests"
  category: "TEST_SUITE"
  status: "STUB"
  description: |
    Evidence that a comprehensive conformance test suite exists and fails CI on
    no-bypass violations, replay across restart, tamper detection failures,
    fail-closed prerequisite missing, anti-rollback anchor bypass, downgrade
    by client, and bounded-work regressions.
  requirement_ids:
    - "REQ-0027"
  source_refs:
    - "documents/rfcs/RFC-0019/requirements/REQ-0027.yaml"
  expected_contents:
    - "No-bypass tests: authoritative endpoints cannot invoke effect/consume/quarantine outside kernel."
    - "Replay tests: duplicate consume denied across restart."
    - "Tamper tests: payload tampering detected via signature verification; chain breaks detected."
    - "Fail-closed prerequisite tests: missing governance policy root or witnesses denies."
    - "Anti-rollback tests: rollback-to-earlier-seal denied when external anchor enforced."
    - "Bounded-work tests: admission hot paths do not scan unbounded ledger history."
    - "Output gating tests: fail-closed tiers cannot release output before post-effect checks."
    - "Digest-cycle regression tests."
    - "Downgrade resistance tests: client cannot force lower tier."
    - "Crash-window tests: restart during various states yields fail-closed behavior."
