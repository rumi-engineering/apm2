  status: "STUB"
  description: |
    Evidence that at least one AntiRollbackAnchor provider is implemented with
    verify_committed(anchor) semantics, integrated into startup verification and
    admission request-time checks, and that fail-closed tiers deny when the external
    anchor is unavailable or inconsistent.
