  status: "STUB"
  description: |
    Evidence that AdmissionBundleV1 is sealed before receipt/event emission,
    no digest cycles exist, and reverse-edge discovery is operational.

    - "CAS storage path for sealed bundles."
    - "Sealing occurs before receipt/event emission in execute() flow."
    - "Tests: digest cycle regression (bundle cannot reference receipt ids created after sealing)."
    - "Tests: reverse-edge discovery (receipts carry bundle digest for O(1) correlation)."
