    Evidence that review outcomes are holon-ready:
    - ViewCommitment is stored in CAS and referenced by hash
    - Review artifacts/receipts bind view_commitment_hash and policy_resolved_ref

    TCK-00325 Implementation Summary:
    1. Implemented `ViewCommitmentV1` struct in `crates/apm2-core/src/fac/view_commitment.rs`.
    2. Updated `ReviewArtifactBundleV1` to include `view_commitment_hash` and `policy_resolved_ref` fields.
    3. Implemented `commit_view` in `WorkspaceManager` to capture workspace state hash.
    4. Updated `apply_with_view_commitment` to store commitment in CAS and return hash.
    5. Updated `create_artifact_bundle` to accept and embed these bindings.
