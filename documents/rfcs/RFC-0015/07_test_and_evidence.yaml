  test_strategy:
    overview: |
      FAC testing follows a multi-layer strategy: unit tests for core components,
      integration tests for protocol stages, property-based tests for invariants,
      and adversarial tests for security boundaries. Evidence binding validation
      is critical for AAT requirements.
