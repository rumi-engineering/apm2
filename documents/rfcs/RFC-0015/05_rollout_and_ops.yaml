  rollout_strategy:
    overview: |
      FAC rollout follows a phased approach with graduated strictness and feature flags.
      Phase 1 focuses on core admission hardening; Phase 2 adds measurement integrity;
      Phase 3 enables autonomous improvement. Context firewall adoption uses a 5-week
      graduated rollout to allow pack completeness improvements.
