    resolved_questions:
      - question_id: Q-RFC-FAC-0001
        resolution: "EXTEND kernel_events.proto"
        rationale: |
          SA-1 analysis: kernel_events.proto uses oneof payload pattern with 8 existing
          event families. GateLease extends LeaseEvent (tag 6); GateRunCompleted and
          MergeReceipt extend EvidenceEvent (tags 3, 4). Follows established pattern,
          minimizes breaking changes, maintains single proto source. Evidence:
          proto/kernel_events.proto:43-54, crates/apm2-core/src/events/apm2.kernel.v1.rs:612-626
        confidence: HIGH

      - question_id: Q-RFC-FAC-0002
        resolution: "ContextAwareValidator middleware at tool validation layer"
        rationale: |
          SA-2 analysis: Tool validation layer (crates/apm2-core/src/tool/validation.rs)
          has clean architecture for extension. Create ContextAwareValidator trait that
          wraps existing Validator with manifest checking. Non-breaking, composable,
          testable. Integration point: crates/apm2-core/src/tool/mod.rs:66-75.
          Probability of success: 0.75 (highest of 3 options analyzed).
        confidence: HIGH

      - question_id: Q-RFC-FAC-0005
        resolution: "Reuse TranscriptChunk from CAC module"
        rationale: |
          SA-2 analysis: CAC module already handles transcript chunking with streaming
          hashing. Create AATTranscriptBinding wrapper that imports TranscriptChunk
          from cac/pack_spec.rs. Avoids duplication, maintains PRD-0007 conformance.
          Reuse rate >= 80%. Evidence: crates/apm2-core/src/cac/pack_spec.rs:1-150.

  architectural_overview:
    summary: |
      FAC implements a hardened admission protocol with seven protocol stages:
      (1) Changeset ingestion with view commitment and policy pinning,
      (2) CI evidence import as observations,
      (3) Review Context Pack compilation,
      (4) Gate-scoped authority minting via leases,
      (5) Gate execution under OCAP context firewall,
      (6) Admission decision with atomic merge receipt,
      (7) Projection sync with divergence watchdog.

      The design ensures cryptographic signing of all gate outcomes, lease-bounded
      executor authority, mechanical context containment, and projection-only GitHub
      integration. AAT gates have enhanced requirements including typed payloads,
      evidence binding, terminal verifier enforcement, and risk-tiered selection.

        SA-1 EXPLORE analysis confirmed: Existing lease infrastructure in crates/apm2-core/src/lease/
        (state.rs:113-149, reducer.rs:1-85) provides extensible base. LeaseIssued proto already
        has registrar_signature field (proto:229-236). GateLease is clean extension with gate_id,
        changeset_digest, policy_hash as additional discriminated fields. Extension point EP-2

      decision: |
        GateLease binds (work_id, gate_id, changeset_digest, executor_actor_id, expiry, policy_hash).

      title: "Projection-Only GitHub with Divergence Watchdog"
      status: HYPOTHESIS
      decision: |
        GitHub is a projection target, never a source of truth. Only HOLON-GITHUB-ADAPTER may
        write to GitHub. A divergence watchdog continuously compares external trunk HEAD to
        latest MergeReceipt result_selector, triggering InterventionFreeze on mismatch.

      status: HYPOTHESIS
      decision: |
        CI conclusions are observations, not truth. READY_FOR_REVIEW transition requires:
        (1) webhook signature verified, (2) raw log/artifact digests imported into CAS,
        (3) adapter attestation signed and committed. Plain 'success' conclusion without
        evidence import is ignored (fail-closed).
      attestation_fields:

      title: "Typed AAT GateReceipt Payloads"
      status: HYPOTHESIS
      decision: |
        AAT outcomes use typed GateReceipt payloads (gate_id=aat) with required fields for
        view commitment binding, determinism tracking, evidence binding, and attestation.
        No standalone AATReceipt event; all AAT-specific data in GateReceipt payload.

      title: "Terminal Verifier Binding for AAT"
      status: HYPOTHESIS
      decision: |
        AAT PASS requires terminal verifier outputs satisfying machine-defined predicates.
        Policy defines scenario_type -> allowed_verifier_kinds + required_outputs + machine_predicate.
        Narrative is non-authoritative.
      allowed_verifier_kinds:
        - exit_code
        - snapshot_diff
        - structured_test_report
        - invariant_check

      title: "Risk-Tiered AAT Selection Policy"
      status: HYPOTHESIS
      decision: |
        AAT selection is risk-tiered: HIGH always requires AAT, MED requires AAT for sensitive
        domains, LOW is sampled with nightly full AAT. Risk tier and selection_policy_id
        recorded in GateReceipt.
      tiers:

      title: "AAT Anti-Downgrade Enforcement"
      status: HYPOTHESIS
      decision: |
        Policy resolution is pinned at FAC-00 ingestion. Admission rejects AAT receipts
        where risk_tier, determinism_class, verifier_policy_hash, or rcp_profile_id are
        lower than resolved values. Downgrades require explicit waiver.
      pinned_at_ingest:

        - resolved_risk_tier
        - resolved_determinism_class
        - resolved_verifier_policy_hash
        - resolved_rcp_profile_id
      enforcement:
        - "policy_hash MUST equal resolved_policy_hash"
        - "risk_tier MUST NOT be lower than resolved_risk_tier"
        - "verifier_policy_hash MUST be allowed for resolved_risk_tier"
