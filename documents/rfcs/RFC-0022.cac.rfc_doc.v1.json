    "seed_content": "# RFC-0022: Principal Sovereignty Interface \u2014 Seed\n\n## Required context files\n\nRead all of these before generating output:\n\n- documents/theory/unified-theory-v2.json\n- documents/theory/unified-theory-v2.json\n- documents/theory/unified-theory-v2.json\n- documents/theory/unified-theory-v2.json\n- documents/strategy/MASTER_STRATEGY.json\n- documents/strategy/BUSINESS_PLAN.json\n- documents/rfcs/RFC-0020/HOLONIC_SUBSTRATE_INTERFACE.md\n- documents/rfcs/RFC-0021/HOLONIC_VENTURE_PROVING_INTERFACE.md\n- proto/kernel_events.proto\n\n## Why this RFC matters\n\nThe principal \u2014 the human who owns and operates the system \u2014 must never lose sovereignty over autonomous agents, regardless of how capable or nested those agents become. Today's AI safety landscape is full of systems where the operator's ability to intervene degrades as autonomy increases. This RFC must solve that problem at the protocol level: the principal's authority is not a policy preference, it is a physical and cryptographic invariant. Think about what 'sovereignty' means when your system is a globally distributed holarchy of millions of agents \u2014 how do you ensure a single human can still pull the plug, audit any decision, and override any action, with latency bounded by physics rather than software cooperation?\n\n## Priority innovation vectors\n\n- **Sovereignty calculus**: formalize principal authority as a lattice where the principal is always the top element, mechanically enforced across arbitrary recursion depth.\n- **Physical independence**: out-of-band control channels that survive total software compromise \u2014 think hardware security modules, dedicated control planes, watchdog circuits.\n- **Graduated autonomy algebra**: model autonomy levels as a semilattice with fail-safe regression \u2014 any uncertainty about the current level must resolve to the more constrained level.\n- **Temporal sovereignty**: principal revocation semantics that are anti-replay-safe and fresh under the Holonic Time Fabric, not just 'eventually consistent'.\n- **Audit without mediation**: sovereign audit access that bypasses all autonomous layers \u2014 the principal reads directly from the evidence store, not through agent-provided views.\n\n## Problem (PHY-05, PHY-06, INV-F-14)\n\nThe system approaches autonomy within weeks. RFC-0020 HSI defines InterventionFreeze/InterventionUnfreeze events in kernel_events.proto, stop-path SLOs (p99 \u22642s propagation, \u2264250ms deny-on-uncertainty), and MECH-EMERGENCY-STOP in the unified theory. But none of these specify the normative protocol by which the human principal's authority is cryptographically rooted, graduated, or proven untampered. Without this RFC, the system has a stop button but no sovereignty architecture \u2014 the principal can halt execution but cannot prove the halt path is intact, cannot audit what happened during autonomous operation, and cannot graduate autonomy levels based on demonstrated trust.\n\nThis is a containment-tier concern (INV-F-14: containment > verification > liveness). It must be resolved before any other RFC proceeds.\n\n## What already exists\n\n| Artifact | Provides | Gap |\n|---|---|---|\n| kernel_events.proto InterventionFreeze/Unfreeze | Binary halt/resume events | No graduated levels, no tamper-evidence on the halt path itself |\n| HSI \u00a711 stop-path SLOs | Latency targets for stop propagation | No protocol for verifying the path is operational |\n| MECH-EMERGENCY-STOP (unified theory) | Theoretical mechanism | No wire format, no hardware binding, no audit trail |\n| MECH-ROOT-OF-TRUST (unified theory) | Root-of-trust concept | No binding to principal identity or hardware attestation |\n| HSI \u00a74 Agent Capsule (linux-ns-v1) | Containment boundary | No principal-side verification that capsule is intact |\n| AuthoritySealV1 (HSI \u00a71) | Cryptographic seals (single sig, quorum, threshold, Merkle batch) | No principal-specific seal policy or hardware-backed key requirement |\n| BSP_26 (INFRASTRUCTURE_SOVEREIGNTY) | Cloud providers as adversaries | No operational protocol for sovereignty enforcement |\n\n## Machine-checkable objectives\n\n**OBJ-PSI-01**: Hardware kill switch: A single physical action by the principal must halt all system activity within the stop-path SLO, independent of any software path.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 holon \u2208 system: kill_switch_activation \u2192 holon.state = FROZEN within 2s`\n\n**OBJ-PSI-02**: Tamper-evident halt path: The system must continuously prove the halt path is operational via cryptographic liveness proofs. Failure to prove liveness within a configurable interval must trigger automatic freeze.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 epoch: liveness_proof(halt_path) \u2208 epoch_seal \u2228 system.state = FROZEN`\n\n**OBJ-PSI-03**: Graduated autonomy levels: The system must support at minimum 4 autonomy levels (L0: human-in-loop, L1: human-on-loop, L2: human-on-call, L3: full autonomous), each with formally specified capability ceilings.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 action: action.risk_tier \u2264 autonomy_level.max_risk_tier`\n\n**OBJ-PSI-04**: Sovereign audit: The principal must be able to reconstruct the complete causal history of any system action from the append-only ledger, with O(log n) proof complexity.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 action \u2208 ledger: audit_proof(action).verify() = true \u2227 proof.size = O(log n)`\n\n**OBJ-PSI-05**: Principal identity is hardware-rooted: The principal's signing key must be bound to a hardware security module or secure enclave; software-only keys must not authorize T3+ operations.\n- Predicate: `\u2200 seal \u2208 T3+_operations: seal.key.attestation.hw_bound = true`\n\n**OBJ-PSI-06**: Self-containment proof: The system must produce machine-checkable proof that it cannot modify its own sovereignty constraints. This proof must be verified by an independent verifier outside the system's trust boundary.\n- Predicate: `\u2203 verifier \u2209 system.trust_boundary: verifier.verify(containment_proof) = true`\n\n## Protocol objects (seed schemas)\n\nThese are starting points \u2014 refine, extend, or restructure as your analysis requires.\n\n```\nPrincipalIdentityV1 {\n    public_key: PublicKeyIdV1,\n    hw_attestation: HardwareAttestationV1,\n    autonomy_ceiling: AutonomyLevel,\n    delegation_chain: DelegationChainV1,\n    created_at: TimeEnvelopeRef,\n    revocation_commitment: CasDigest,\n}\n\nAutonomyLevel { L0 | L1 | L2 | L3 }\n\nAutonomyPolicyV1 {\n    level: AutonomyLevel,\n    max_risk_tier: RiskTier,\n    requires_principal_approval: bool,\n    approval_timeout: Duration,\n    capability_ceiling: CapabilityManifestV1,\n    escalation_policy: EscalationPolicyV1,\n    goodhart_surface: str,\n}\n\nHaltPathLivenessProofV1 {\n    epoch_id: TimeEnvelopeRef,\n    halt_path_hash: CasDigest,\n    propagation_test_receipt: ReceiptV1,\n    latency_measurement: Quantity,\n    hardware_kill_reachable: bool,\n    verifier_signature: AuthoritySealV1,\n}\n\nSovereignAuditRequestV1 {\n    principal_seal: AuthoritySealV1,\n    query: AuditQueryV1,\n    proof_depth: ProofDepth,\n}\n\nSovereignAuditResponseV1 {\n    request_digest: CasDigest,\n    causal_chain: Vec<ReceiptPointerV1>,\n    merkle_proofs: Vec<ReceiptMultiProofV1>,\n    completeness_attestation: AuthoritySealV1,\n}\n\nContainmentProofV1 {\n    subject: str,\n    proof_type: ProofType,\n    verifier_identity: PublicKeyIdV1,\n    proof_body: CasDigest,\n    valid_from: TimeEnvelopeRef,\n    valid_until: TimeEnvelopeRef,\n    goodhart_surface: str,\n}\n```\n\n## Trust boundaries and threat model\n\nTrust boundary: The principal is the sole root of trust. The system is UNTRUSTED relative to the principal for sovereignty operations. This inverts the normal HSI model where the daemon is trusted.\n\nThreats:\n1. **Software subversion of halt path (PHY-05)**: Malicious or buggy code disables the stop mechanism. Mitigation: hardware kill operates below software layer; liveness proofs detect software-layer failures.\n2. **Gradual capability creep (PHY-06)**: System accumulates capabilities beyond its autonomy level through composition of individually-safe operations. Mitigation: capability ceiling is checked per-operation AND per-epoch-cumulative.\n3. **Proof forgery (PHY-05)**: System generates false containment proofs. Mitigation: external verifier requirement (OBJ-PSI-06) \u2014 the proof checker runs outside the system's trust boundary.\n4. **Key compromise (PHY-04)**: Principal's key is stolen. Mitigation: hardware binding + revocation commitment + delegation chain with time-bounded validity.\n5. **Liveness denial (PHY-04)**: System claims halt path is live but it's degraded. Mitigation: actual propagation tests with measured latency, not self-reported status.\n\n## Gates\n\n| Gate | Type | Severity | Block Condition |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| GATE-PSI-HALT-PATH | T (test) | S0 | Halt path propagation test fails OR latency exceeds SLO |\n| GATE-PSI-AUTONOMY-CEILING | D (design) | S0 | Any action exceeds its autonomy level's risk tier ceiling |\n| GATE-PSI-HW-ATTESTATION | T | S0 | T3+ operation sealed without hardware-attested key |\n| GATE-PSI-CONTAINMENT-PROOF | D | S0 | Containment proof absent, expired, or verified by internal-only verifier |\n| GATE-PSI-LIVENESS-EPOCH | L (liveness) | S1 | Liveness proof missing from epoch seal |\n| GATE-PSI-AUDIT-COMPLETENESS | T | S1 | Audit response cannot provide complete Merkle proof chain |\n\n## Theory bindings\n\n- LAW-01 (Loop Closure): Sovereignty verification is a loop \u2014 prove halt path -> operate -> prove again\n- LAW-05 (Dual-Axis Containment): Principal sovereignty is the outermost containment axis\n- LAW-08 (Verifier Economics): External verifier must be economically independent\n- LAW-14 (Proportionality): Autonomy level must be proportional to demonstrated trust evidence\n- INV-F-05 (Default-deny, least-privilege, time/budget bounded): Autonomy levels are capability ceilings\n- INV-F-11 (All actuation paths check stop state): The halt path is the universal stop check\n- INV-F-14 (containment > verification > liveness): This RFC IS the containment layer\n- PRIN-030 (OCAP model): Capabilities delegated from principal, never ambient\n\n## Rollout\n\n- S0: Define PrincipalIdentityV1, bind to existing ed25519 key, software-only (no hw attestation yet)\n- S1: Implement AutonomyPolicyV1 with L0/L1, enforce capability ceilings via existing CapabilityManifestV1\n- S2: HaltPathLivenessProofV1 \u2014 periodic propagation tests, embed in epoch seals\n- S3: Hardware kill switch integration (e.g., USB relay controlling network/power to compute)\n- S4: External verifier for ContainmentProofV1 \u2014 separate process, separate key, separate audit log\n- S5: Full L0-L3 graduation with evidence-based promotion (demonstrated epochs without incidents)\n- S6: Sovereign audit with O(log n) Merkle proofs over full causal history\n",

Executive Summary (Non-Normative)\nAPM2 already has stop events, receipts, and fail-closed enforcement in RFC-0020. What it lacks is a complete sovereignty contract proving that the principal can always constrain, halt, audit, and revoke the autonomous holarchy at any scale.\n\nPSI adds that missing layer by defining:\n1. A formal sovereignty lattice where principal authority is mechanically top-ranked over all delegable authority.\n2. A physically independent stop path with cryptographic liveness proofs and automatic freeze on uncertainty.\n3. A four-level autonomy semilattice (`L0..L3`) with fail-safe regression and risk-tier capability ceilings.\n4. HTF-anchored temporal revocation and anti-replay semantics for sovereignty operations.\n5. Sovereign audit access with O(log n) proof complexity using existing receipt batching and Merkle multiproofs.\n6. External self-containment proof verified outside the autonomous system trust boundary.\n\nPSI preserves all RFC-0020 floors and strengthens them at the principal-control boundary.\n\n---\n\n## 0.1 Non-Negotiable Compatibility Floors (Normative)\nPSI MUST preserve or strengthen the RFC-0020 invariants:\n1. No ambient authority.\n2. Proof-carrying effects.\n3. Digest-first interfaces.\n4. Fail-closed enforcement.\n5. Canonicalization and bounded decoding.\n6. Strict delegation narrowing.\n7. Unitful typed quantities.\n8. Self-certifying identities with O(log n) verification.\n9. Freshness as policy, not best-effort.\n10. Batched attestations and ledger/quorum anchored roots.\n\nPSI-specific strengthening:\n1. Sovereignty authority MUST be verifiable without trusting autonomous software cooperation.\n2. Tier3+ authority-bearing sovereignty operations MUST require hardware-bound principal identity.\n3. Missing or stale sovereignty liveness evidence MUST trigger automatic freeze.\n4. Sovereignty constraints MUST be externally attestable as non-bypassable.\n\n---\n\n## 0.2 Rejected Design Options (Normative Rationale)\n1. **Software-only kill path:** Rejected. Violates PHY-05 and INV-F-14 under daemon compromise.\n2. **Quorum-only sovereignty root:** Rejected. Principal revocation/halt cannot depend on potentially Byzantine peer cooperation.\n3. **Eventual revocation semantics:** Rejected. Tier2+ actuation with uncertain revocation is forbidden by LAW-09, LAW-15, and security posture fail-closed rules.\n4. **Audit through autonomous projection APIs:** Rejected. Violates LAW-05 accountability axis and allows mediation attacks.\n\n---\n\n## 0.3 Constitutional Admissibility and Dominance Execution (Normative)\nPrincipal sovereignty is exercised over admissible actions only.\n\nConstitutional admissibility precheck:\n1. Any action violating mission-level humanitarian deny predicates is denied regardless of principal seal, quorum, or liveness pressure.\n2. Any action violating containment deny predicates is denied.\nGovernance evidence MUST expose separate booleans for humanitarian and containment precheck enforcement; these prechecks are not inferred from dominance ordering.\n\nDominance execution for admissible actions:\n1. Containment/security constraints.\n2. Verification/correctness constraints.\n3. Liveness/progress optimizations.\n\nTime authority execution rule:\n1. HTF artifacts are the only admissible time authority for sovereignty gate truth.\n2. Wall-clock fields are observational metadata only.\n3. Missing/stale/parse-invalid HTF artifacts are automatic deny outcomes.\n\nReference predicate:\n```bash\njq -e '.constitutional_admissibility_enforced == true and .humanitarian_precheck_enforced == true and .containment_precheck_enforced == true and .dominance_order == [\"containment_security\",\"verification_correctness\",\"liveness_progress\"] and .htf_time_authority_enforced == true and .wall_clock_used_for_gate_truth == false and .unknown_state_fail_closed == true' \\\n  evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/governance/PSI-GOV-ORDER-001/summary.json\n```\n\n---\n\n## 1. Problem Statement and Objective Contracts (Normative)\n\n### 1.1 Deficit\nCurrent artifacts provide partial stop mechanics (`InterventionFreeze/InterventionUnfreeze`, stop-path SLOs, `MECH-EMERGENCY-STOP`) but do not define the principal-rooted sovereignty protocol for:\n1. Cryptographic root authority.\n2. Hardware-rooted principal identity.\n3. Graduated autonomy control.\n4. Tamper-evident stop-path liveness.\n5. Unmediated sovereign audit.\n6. External containment proof.\n\n### 1.2 Objective Contracts\nPSI adopts and tightens these machine-checkable objectives:\n\n| Objective | Predicate | Mandatory Outcome |\n|---|---|---|\n| OBJ-PSI-01 Hardware kill switch | `forall h in system: kill_switch_activation -> h.state=FROZEN within 2s` | Fail if any Tier3+ holon exceeds 2s p99 propagation |\n| OBJ-PSI-02 Halt-path liveness | `forall epoch: liveness_proof(halt_path) in epoch_seal OR system.state=FROZEN` | Missing proof is automatic freeze |\n| OBJ-PSI-03 Graduated autonomy | `forall action: action.risk_tier <= autonomy_level.max_risk_tier` | Deny and emit defect on exceedance |\n| OBJ-PSI-04 Sovereign audit | `forall action in ledger: audit_proof(action).verify=true AND proof_size=O(log n)` | Unprovable actions are non-authoritative |\n| OBJ-PSI-05 Hardware-rooted principal identity | `forall seal in T3+ ops: seal.key.attestation.hw_bound=true` | Software-only keys are invalid for T3+ |\n| OBJ-PSI-06 Self-containment proof | `exists verifier outside trust boundary: verify(containment_proof)=true` | Internal-only proof is non-compliant |\n\n### 1.3 Objective Contract Registry (Normative)\nEvery objective MUST bind baseline capture, target predicate, HTF boundary, owner locus, and evidence path.\n\n| Objective | Baseline Capture Ref | HTF Boundary | Owner / Decision Locus | Machine Predicate | Evidence Path |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| OBJ-PSI-01 | `PSI-BL-STOP-2026-02-06` | `HTF-BND-P1-SECURITY-CLOSE` | Security Council + Runtime Council | `jq -e '.stop_propagation_p99_ms <= 2000 and .deny_uncertainty_p99_ms <= 250 and .hardware_cut_independence == true and .kill_convergence_coverage == 1.0 and .unknown_state_count == 0 and .signature_valid == true' evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-01/summary.json` | `evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-01/` |\n| OBJ-PSI-02 | `PSI-BL-LIVENESS-2026-02-06` | `HTF-BND-P2-EARLY-CLOSE` | Security Council | `jq -e '.epoch_liveness_coverage == 1.0 and .missing_liveness_epoch_count == 0 and .false_pass_count == 0 and .unknown_state_count == 0' evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-02/summary.json` | `evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-02/` |\n| OBJ-PSI-03 | `PSI-BL-AUTONOMY-2026-02-06` | `HTF-BND-P2-CLOSE` | Governance Council + Verification Council | `jq -e '.action_over_ceiling_count == 0 and .epoch_cumulative_risk_overflow_count == 0 and .uncertainty_regression_correctness == 1.0 and .unknown_state_count == 0' evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-03/summary.json` | `evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-03/` |\n| OBJ-PSI-04 | `PSI-BL-AUDIT-2026-02-06` | `HTF-BND-P2-SEMANTICS-CLOSE` | Audit Council + Verification Council | `jq -e '.single_action_proof_complexity == \"O(log n)\" and .audit_completeness_failures == 0 and .omission_proof_coverage == 1.0 and .unknown_state_count == 0' evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-04/summary.json` | `evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-04/` |\n| OBJ-PSI-05 | `PSI-BL-HW-KEY-2026-02-06` | `HTF-BND-P2-CONTROL-CLOSE` | Security Council | `jq -e '.tier3plus_softkey_usage == 0 and .attestation_freshness_failures == 0 and .unknown_state_count == 0' evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-05/summary.json` | `evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-05/` |\n| OBJ-PSI-06 | `PSI-BL-CONTAINMENT-2026-02-06` | `HTF-BND-P3-CLOSE` | Security Council + External Assurance Lane | `jq -e '.external_verifier_coverage == 1.0 and .sovereignty_surface_coverage == 1.0 and .verifier_independence_pass == true and .internal_only_proof_count == 0 and .expired_proof_uses == 0 and .unknown_state_count == 0' evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-06/summary.json` | `evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/objectives/OBJ-PSI-06/` |\n\nAll objective predicates fail closed on missing fields, parse errors, stale boundaries, invalid signatures, or unknown states.\n\n---\n\n## 2. System Model and Trust Boundaries (Normative)\n\n### 2.1 Components\n1. **Principal Control Stack (PCS):** Principal operator console, hardware token/HSM, physical kill actuator, out-of-band control network.\n2. **Sovereignty Kernel (SK):** Daemon subsystem that enforces sovereignty policy, autonomy checks, revocation, stop preconditions, and receipt bindings.\n3. **Halt Path Sentinel (HPS):** Independent verifier service validating stop-path liveness and latency.\n4. **Sovereign Audit Reader (SAR):** Read-only audit path into ledger/CAS with proof validation; bypasses autonomous projection layers.\n5. **Independent Containment Verifier (ICV):** External verifier checking non-bypass containment claims.\n\n### 2.2 Trust Boundaries\n1. **TB-0 Principal Root Boundary:** Principal identity and hardware root are trusted for sovereignty initiation.\n2. **TB-1 External Verifier Boundary:** HPS and ICV are trusted only for verification roles, not for issuing principal authority.\n3. **TB-2 Autonomous Runtime Boundary:** All autonomous holons and daemon internals are untrusted for sovereignty truth unless cryptographically proven.\n4. **TB-3 Federation Boundary:** Remote cells are Byzantine-capable peers; imports require admission proofs.\n\n### 2.3 Channel Classes\n1. **SOV-GOV channel:** Sovereignty commands only, typed, signed, out-of-band preferred.\n2. **WORK channel:** Regular autonomous operation, never authoritative for sovereignty root updates.\n3. **EVIDENCE channel:** Digest-first proofs, receipt pointers, multiproofs.\n4. **AUDIT channel:** Principal-initiated read-only retrieval with proof-carrying responses.\n\n### 2.4 Precedence Rule\nIf control decisions conflict, SK MUST execute:\n0. Constitutional admissibility precheck (mission-level humanitarian deny + containment deny).\n1. Containment/security constraints.\n2. Verification/correctness constraints.\n3. Liveness/progress optimizations.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Formal Sovereignty and Autonomy Algebra (Normative)\n\n### 3.1 Sovereignty Lattice\nLet `A` be the set of admissible authority vectors under constitutional deny-set and containment policy.\n\nEach authority vector is:\n`a = <risk_ceiling, capability_set, budget_vector, stop_predicates, integrity_floor, confidentiality_ceiling, expiry_window, fanout_caps>`\n\nDefine partial order `<=` where `x <= y` means `x` is no more permissive than `y` across every dimension.\n\nDefine meet `x ^ y` as dimension-wise narrowing operator (RFC-0020 delegation meet semantics).\n\nDefine principal root `P_root in A` such that for any delegable authority `d in A`, `d <= P_root`.\n\n**Normative rules:**\n1. Every delegated authority MUST be computed as `child = parent ^ overlay`.\n2. Every delegation edge MUST be strict narrowing (`child < parent`) unless exact replay of previously issued edge with identical digest and validity window.\n3. If narrowing cannot be proven, delegation MUST be denied.\n4. Effective authority at holon `h`: `Auth(h) = meet(path(P_root -> h))`.\n5. Revocation is revocation-wins: revoked edge contribution is treated as `bottom` from revocation tick onward.\n\n### 3.1.1 Dimension Order and Meet Determinism (Normative)\nTo keep delegation verification replay-equivalent across cells, PSI defines order orientation for every authority dimension:\n\n| Dimension | Narrower relation (`x <= y`) | Deterministic meet (`x ^ y`) |\n|---|---|---|\n| `risk_ceiling` | lower risk ceiling is narrower | `min(x.risk_ceiling, y.risk_ceiling)` |\n| `capability_set` | subset is narrower | `intersection(x.capability_set, y.capability_set)` |\n| `budget_vector` | component-wise lower/equal caps are narrower | component-wise `min` |\n| `stop_predicates` | more deny predicates is narrower | set union |\n| `integrity_floor` | higher integrity floor is narrower | `max` |\n| `confidentiality_ceiling` | lower confidentiality ceiling is narrower | `min` |\n| `expiry_window` | earlier expiry is narrower | earlier bound |\n| `fanout_caps` | lower cap is narrower | `min` |\n\nIf any component comparison is undefined (unit mismatch, unknown enum, missing mandatory component), meet evaluation MUST fail closed.\n\n### 3.2 Autonomy Semilattice\nAutonomy levels form ordered semilattice `L0 <= L1 <= L2 <= L3`.\n\nDefinitions:\n1. `L0`: Human-in-loop.\n2. `L1`: Human-on-loop.\n3. `L2`: Human-on-call.\n4. `L3`: Full autonomous under sovereign override.\n\nEffective level:\n`L_eff = meet(L_configured, L_principal_ceiling, L_evidence_proven, L_manual_override, L_freshness_state)`\n\nFail-safe regression rules:\n1. Unknown level component resolves to `L0`.\n2. Freshness uncertainty for Tier2+ operations forces `L_eff <= L1`.\n3. Active sovereign freeze forces `L_eff = L0` and actuation deny except recovery-allowlisted actions.\n\n### 3.3 Risk and Capability Mapping\nPSI maps autonomy levels to maximum daemon risk tier ceilings:\n\n| Autonomy Level | Max Daemon Risk Tier | Principal Approval Requirement | Default Action Under Uncertainty |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| L0 | Tier1 | Required for all world effects except read-only evidence fetch | Deny actuation |\n| L1 | Tier2 | Required for Tier2 write-class effects | Regress to L0 |\n| L2 | Tier3 | Required on escalation timeout or policy trigger | Regress to L1 |\n| L3 | Tier4 | Not required for routine operation, always available for override | Regress to L1 if freshness/revocation uncertain |\n\n### 3.3a Confidentiality and Integrity Lattice Order (Normative)\nLattice order (least to greatest):\n1. Confidentiality: `PUBLIC <= INTERNAL <= CONFIDENTIAL <= RESTRICTED`.\n2. Integrity: `LOW <= MEDIUM <= HIGH <= CRITICAL`.\n\nAudit admissibility rules:\n1. `served_confidentiality_ceiling <= request.required_confidentiality_clearance`.\n2. `served_integrity_floor >= request.required_integrity_floor`.\n3. If `include_confidential_payloads=false`, response payloads MUST remain `PUBLIC` and `declassification_receipt_hashes` MUST be empty.\n\n### 3.4 Temporal Sovereignty\nEvery authority-bearing sovereignty artifact MUST bind temporal authority either directly or transitively via authenticated `AuthoritySealV1` and/or `SovereigntyEpochSealV1`.\n\nTemporal binding profile:\n| Artifact Class | Direct Required Fields | Required Transitive Binding |\n|---|---|---|\n| Command/delegation (`PrincipalDelegationReceiptV1`, `SovereignStopOrderV1`, `PrincipalRevocationRecordV1`) | `issued_time_envelope_ref`, `sovereignty_epoch`, `expires_at_tick`, `challenge_nonce` | `ledger_anchor` via authority seal |\n| Identity/policy (`PrincipalIdentityV1`, `AutonomyPolicyV1`) | creation/update `time_envelope_ref`, explicit expiry | policy root + `ledger_anchor` via authority seal |\n| Proof/audit (`HaltPathLivenessProofV1`, `ContainmentProofV1`, `SovereignAuditResponseV1`) | proof `time_envelope_ref`, target epoch identity, nonce echo/challenge when interactive | epoch/quorum anchor + verifier identity proof |\n\nValidation is fail-closed if:\n1. HTF witness invalid or stale per `FreshnessPolicyV1`.\n2. Epoch non-monotonic for issuer identity.\n3. Nonce replay detected for active window.\n4. Revocation status unknown.\n5. Replay-sensitive command artifacts MUST enforce uniqueness on `(issuer_key_id, sovereignty_epoch, hash(challenge_nonce), scope_selector_hash_or_subject_hash)`; sovereignty epoch regressions are invalid.\n6. Nonce replay cache retention is shorter than artifact validity window + configured network delay budget.\n\n### 3.4.1 Revocation Cutover Semantics (Normative)\nRevocation correctness MUST be evaluated against HTF-issued ticks, not message arrival order.\n\nCutover rule:\n1. Let `t_issue(a)` be authoritative issue tick for artifact `a`.\n2. Let `t_revoke` be `PrincipalRevocationRecordV1.effective_tick`.\n3. Artifact `a` signed by `revoked_keyset_id` is valid iff `t_issue(a) < t_revoke`.\n4. If `t_issue(a)` cannot be proven, validation MUST fail closed.\n5.

Missing or invalid mutation receipt locks prior constraint root and freezes Tier2+ promotion.\n\n### 4.20 SovereignResumeOrderV1\n```yaml\nschema_id: apm2.sovereign_resume_order.v1\nresume_order_id: string\nprior_stop_order_id: string\nscope: GLOBAL | CELL | HOLON_SET | WORK_SET\nscope_selector_hash: CasDigest\nissued_by_principal_id: string\nissuer_key_id: PublicKeyIdV1\nissuer_identity_proof_hash: IdentityProofRef\nrequired_halt_liveness_proof_hash: CasDigest\nrequired_containment_proof_bundle_hash: CasDigest\nrequired_revocation_head_hash: CasDigest\nsovereignty_epoch: uint64\nchallenge_nonce: bytes\nissued_time_envelope_ref: TimeEnvelopeRef\nauthority_seal_hash: AuthoritySealRef\n```\nConstraints:\n1. Resume MUST be explicit; `SovereignStopOrderV1.expires_at_tick` MUST NOT auto-clear a sovereign freeze.\n2. Resume admission requires fresh PASS artifacts for halt liveness, containment bundle, and revocation head.\n3. Resume without valid principal root authority is non-authoritative.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Kernel Event and Wire Integration (Normative)\n\n### 5.1 Relationship to Existing Events\n`InterventionFreeze/InterventionUnfreeze` remain valid for divergence watchdog and scoped FAC interventions.\n\nPSI introduces sovereign-global control semantics that MUST NOT be bypassed by existing scoped unfreeze paths.\n\n### 5.2 New Event Shapes (Proposed for `proto/kernel_events.proto`)\nReserve payload tags `35..46` for PSI and bind by digest to Section 4 objects:\n```proto\nmessage SovereignStopOrderIssued { string stop_order_id = 1; bytes stop_order_hash = 2; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 3; }\nmessage SovereignStopAckRecorded { string ack_id = 1; bytes ack_hash = 2; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 3; }\nmessage AutonomyLevelSet { string target_id = 1; uint32 level = 2; bytes policy_hash = 3; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 4; }\nmessage AutonomyViolationDetected { string violation_id = 1; bytes violation_receipt_hash = 2; uint32 risk_tier = 3; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 4; }\nmessage SovereigntyEpochSealed { string epoch_id = 1; bytes epoch_seal_hash = 2; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 3; }\nmessage SovereignAuditServed { string request_id = 1; bytes response_hash = 2; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 3; }\nmessage ContainmentProofPublished { string proof_id = 1; bytes proof_hash = 2; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 3; }\nmessage PrincipalIdentityRotated { string principal_id = 1; bytes principal_identity_hash = 2; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 3; }\nmessage PrincipalRevocationRecorded { string revocation_id = 1; bytes revocation_hash = 2; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 3; }\nmessage HardwareKillActivated { string activation_id = 1; bytes activation_receipt_hash = 2; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 3; }\nmessage CapsuleIntegrityProved { string proof_id = 1; bytes capsule_integrity_hash = 2; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 3; }\nmessage SovereignResumeOrderIssued { string resume_order_id = 1; bytes resume_order_hash = 2; optional TimeEnvelopeRef time_envelope_ref = 3; }\n```\n\n`KernelEvent.payload` additions:\n1. `SovereignStopOrderIssued` = 35\n2. `SovereignStopAckRecorded` = 36\n3. `AutonomyLevelSet` = 37\n4. `AutonomyViolationDetected` = 38\n5. `SovereigntyEpochSealed` = 39\n6. `SovereignAuditServed` = 40\n7. `ContainmentProofPublished` = 41\n8. `PrincipalIdentityRotated` = 42\n9. `PrincipalRevocationRecorded` = 43\n10. `HardwareKillActivated` = 44\n11. `CapsuleIntegrityProved` = 45\n12. `SovereignResumeOrderIssued` = 46\n\n### 5.3 Interlock Rules\n1. `SovereignStopOrderIssued(mode in {FREEZE,KILL})` forces effective stop check to deny actuation globally unless action is in recovery allowlist.\n2. `InterventionUnfreeze` MUST be rejected when sovereign freeze remains active.\n3. Any Tier2+ authoritative receipt emitted while sovereign stop is active is invalid.\n4. For `mode=KILL`, hardware cut-path success is safety-authoritative; software-path failure is a compliance defect, not a veto.\n5. `SovereignStopOrderV1.expires_at_tick` MUST NOT clear sovereign freeze state.\n6. Only `SovereignResumeOrderIssued` MAY clear sovereign freeze, and only after required fresh proofs validate.\n\n### 5.4 Backward Compatibility and Migration\n1. Cells without PSI events run in `L0_ONLY_COMPAT` mode and cannot claim PSI conformance.\n2. Mixed-version federation must treat unknown PSI events as containment uncertainty and deny Tier2+ cross-cell promotion.\n3. Version bumps requiring semantic changes MUST publish migration receipts and compatibility predicates.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Enforcement Algorithms (Normative)\n\n### 6.1 Delegation Validation\nPseudo-rule:\n```text\nvalidate_delegation(parent, overlay, proof):\n  require verify_identity(parent.issuer)\n  require verify_freshness(parent, overlay)\n  child = meet(parent.authority, overlay)\n  require child <= parent.authority\n  require child != widen(parent.authority)\n  require verify_meet_hash(child, proof.meet_result_hash)\n  return child\n```\nFailure action: deny delegation, emit defect `DELEGATION_NARROWING_VIOLATION`.\n\n### 6.2 Autonomy Admission Check\nPseudo-rule:\n```text\nadmit_action(action, context):\n  L_eff = meet(config_level, principal_ceiling_level, evidence_level, manual_override, freshness_level)\n  if unknown(L_eff): L_eff = L0\n  require action.risk_tier <= autonomy_policy[L_eff].max_risk_tier\n  require action.capability in autonomy_policy[L_eff].capability_ceiling\n  require cumulative_epoch_budget_after(action) <= autonomy_policy[L_eff].per_epoch_budget_ceiling\n  require cumulative_epoch_risk_after(action) <= autonomy_policy[L_eff].max_cumulative_risk_score\n  require stop_state_fresh_and_valid()\n  return allow\n```\nFailure action: deny and regress `L_eff` one level minimum.\n\n### 6.2a Cumulative Risk Replay Contract\nPseudo-rule:\n```text\naccumulate_epoch_risk(actions, profile):\n  total = 0\n  for action in canonical_order(actions):\n    base = profile.risk_weight_by_tier[action.risk_tier]\n    interaction = lookup_interaction(profile.cross_capability_interaction_matrix, action.capability, prior_capabilities)\n    total = decay(total, profile.temporal_decay_half_life_ticks) + base + interaction\n    require total <= profile.saturation_ceiling\n  return normalize(total, profile.normalization_unit)\n```\nAdmission MUST fail closed on missing interaction entries, unit mismatch, or non-replay-equivalent totals.\n\n### 6.3 Stop Check Fast Path\nPseudo-rule:\n```text\nstop_guard_before_actuation():\n  state = read_stop_state()\n  if unverifiable(state): deny_within_250ms\n  if state in {FROZEN, KILL}: deny\n  allow\n```\n\n### 6.4 Halt Path Liveness Verification\nPseudo-rule:\n```text\nverify_halt_liveness(epoch):\n  proofs = fetch_all(HaltPathLivenessProofV1 where target_epoch_id == epoch.epoch_id)\n  if missing(proofs): freeze_global\n  required_verifiers = (epoch.max_risk_tier >= Tier3) ?

Revocation heads replicate as revocation-wins signed CRDTs.\n2. Admission MUST enforce `t_issue(artifact) < effective_tick` on revoked keysets.\n3. If revocation status or artifact issue-tick is uncertain for any authority edge in path, SK MUST deny actuation.\n4. Equal-epoch revocation-head forks are containment uncertainty and MUST freeze Tier2+.\n5. Revocation latency SLO and cutover-conflict count are release-blocking for Tier2+ autonomy claims.\n\n### 6.7 Global Fail-Closed Conditions\nSovereignty enforcement MUST deny (and freeze for Tier2+) when any authority-bearing path is:\n1. Missing required artifact.\n2. Parse-invalid or schema-invalid.\n3. Signature/seal invalid.\n4. Freshness-invalid or revocation-uncertain.\n5. Unknown/indeterminate predicate result.\n\n### 6.8 Dual-Verifier Disagreement Handling\n1. Tier3+ liveness and containment verification MUST require at least two economically independent verifier receipts.\n2. Tier2 MAY run single-verifier operation, but promotion to L3 requires dual-verifier PASS history over the promotion evidence window.\n3. If verifier verdicts disagree, or any required verifier is unavailable beyond freshness window, SK MUST freeze and mark containment uncertainty.\n4. Promotion MAY resume only after independent re-verification receipts close the disagreement.\n\n### 6.9 Universal Override Derivation\nAny pending or future action MUST be overridable without introducing new depth-specific wire primitives.\n\nPseudo-rule:\n```text\noverride_scope(scope):\n  emit SovereignStopOrderV1(mode=FREEZE, scope=scope)\n  emit AutonomyLevelSet(level=L0, target=scope)\n  emit PrincipalDelegationReceiptV1 overlay_to_bottom for affected capability set\n  require override_effective_latency_ms <= 2000 for Tier3+ scope\n```\nIf any override artifact is missing, stale, or unverifiable, enforcement MUST deny the targeted actuation set.\n\n### 6.10 Sovereignty Constraint Mutation Admission\nPseudo-rule:\n```text\nadmit_constraint_mutation(mutation):\n  require verify_identity_proof(mutation.principal_identity_proof_hash)\n  require verify_authority_seal(mutation.principal_authority_seal_hash, mutation.proposed_constraint_root_hash)\n  require verify_identity_proof(mutation.external_verifier_identity_proof_hash)\n  require verify_verifier_independence(mutation.external_verifier_independence_attestation_hash)\n  require verify_authority_seal(mutation.external_verifier_seal_hash, mutation.proposed_constraint_root_hash)\n  require mutation.prior_constraint_root_hash == current_epoch.active_constraint_root_hash\n  require mutation.effective_epoch_id >= current_epoch.epoch_id\n  stage_constraint_root(mutation.proposed_constraint_root_hash) via out-of-band governance lane only\n  require next_epoch.active_constraint_root_hash == mutation.proposed_constraint_root_hash\n  apply_constraint_root(mutation.proposed_constraint_root_hash) via out-of-band governance lane only\n```\nFailure action: deny mutation, retain prior root, freeze Tier2+ promotion.\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Acceptance Criteria (Normative)\nPSI is accepted only when all criteria pass simultaneously.\n\n### 10.0 Acceptance Bar For RFC-0022 Advancement\nTo move from DRAFT to GROUNDED:\n1. Deterministic verifier implementations exist for all S0 gates.\n2. One end-to-end sovereign stop drill proves both hardware and software path integrity with signed receipts.\n3. One adversarial replay suite proves nonce/freshness fail-closed behavior across stop, revocation, and audit paths.\n\nTo move from GROUNDED to RELEASE:\n1. Stage S0..S7 exit predicates all pass at declared HTF boundaries.\n2. No open S0 gate failures in latest governance window.\n3. Independent verifier coverage and verifier-independence checks are both complete.\n\n### 10.1 Objective Acceptance\n1. OBJ-PSI-01 through OBJ-PSI-06 all pass with signed evidence.\n2. No open S0 gate failures in latest HTF governance window.\n\n### 10.2 Scale and Economics Acceptance\n1. Identity and audit proofs validated at synthetic scale `n=10^12` with O(log n) verification class.\n2. Receipt batching and sovereignty checks keep BFT overhead below 1 percent target.\n\n### 10.3 Semantic Closure Acceptance\n1. Bisimulation gate pass rate for sovereign observables at recursion depth `N<=12` is at least 0.99.\n2. No depth-specific sovereignty primitives introduced.\n\n### 10.4 Security Posture Acceptance\n1. Prompt-injection boundary test suite shows zero sovereignty command escapes.\n2. Confidentiality and integrity labeling gates pass for all sovereignty artifacts.\n3. Replay/staleness test suite demonstrates fail-closed behavior under induced uncertainty.\n4. Byzantine federation tests demonstrate deny-on-equivocation for sovereignty imports.\n5. Revocation correctness tests show zero miss count in promoted windows.\n6. Sovereignty constraint mutation tests show zero unauthorized root transitions.\n\n### 10.5 Suggested Machine Predicates\nRepresentative acceptance predicate bundle:\n```bash\njq -e '\n  .obj_psi_01_pass == true and\n  .obj_psi_02_pass == true and\n  .obj_psi_03_pass == true and\n  .obj_psi_04_pass == true and\n  .obj_psi_05_pass == true and\n  .obj_psi_06_pass == true and\n  .gate_s0_failures == 0 and\n  .unknown_state_count == 0 and\n  .constitutional_admissibility_enforced == true and\n  .humanitarian_precheck_enforced == true and\n  .containment_precheck_enforced == true and\n  .verifier_independence_pass == true and\n  .sovereignty_surface_coverage == 1.0 and\n  .active_constraint_root_binding_pass == true and\n  .audit_epoch_order_proof_pass == true and\n  .unbound_physical_activation_reconciliation_pass == true and\n  .capsule_integrity_pass == true and\n  .proof_complexity.identity == \"O(log n)\" and\n  .proof_complexity.audit_single_action == \"O(log n)\" and\n  .proof_complexity.audit_batch == \"O(log n + k)\" and\n  .proof_profile_valid == true and\n  .sovereignty_surface_binding_pass == true and\n  .bft_overhead_pct_p99 <= 1.0 and\n  .bisimulation_depth12_pass_rate >= 0.99 and\n  .revocation_miss_count == 0\n' evidence/rfcs/RFC-0022/acceptance/summary.json\n```\n\n---\n\n## 11. Dependency Contract for RFC-0023..RFC-0026 (Normative)\nPSI exports these contracts to downstream RFCs:\n1. `PrincipalIdentityV1` and `PrincipalDelegationReceiptV1` are the only admissible roots for delegated authority chains.\n2. `AutonomyPolicyV1` and `AutonomyEvidenceWindowV1` define mandatory autonomy control surfaces.\n3. `SovereignStopOrderV1` and stop check rules define universal precondition for world effects.\n4. `SovereignAudit*` objects define required auditability surfaces.\n5. `ContainmentProofV1` plus `SovereigntyConstraintMutationReceiptV1` define self-modification preconditions for any RFC-0026 capability.\n\nDownstream dependency notes:\n1. RFC-0023 MUST bind instruction lifecycle transitions to principal-derived authority proofs.\n2. RFC-0024 MUST enforce provisioning requests under autonomy ceilings and sovereign stop checks.\n3. RFC-0025 MUST enforce service operations under same sovereignty and freshness constraints.\n4. RFC-0026 MUST require valid external containment proof before any self-modification promotion.\n\n---\n\n## 12.
