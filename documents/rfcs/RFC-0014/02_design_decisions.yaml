  architectural_overview:
    summary: |
      The distributed consensus layer employs a hybrid architecture scoped to local quorums
      (4-7 nodes): HotStuff/PBFT-based BFT consensus for control plane operations
      (authority events) and CRDT/anti-entropy for data plane observations. This aligns
      with LAW-03, LAW-10, and PHY-04. The network assumption is p99 < 500ms latency.
      Planetary-scale federation is explicitly deferred.

      title: "Hybrid Consensus Model (OPT-HYBRID)"
      status: DECIDED
      decision: |
        Employ HotStuff/PBFT-based BFT consensus for control plane events (total ordering)
        and CRDT/anti-entropy for data plane observations (eventual consistency).
      alternatives:
        - id: ALT-0001-A
          name: "OPT-SEQ: Single-writer sequencer per namespace"
          rejected_reason: |
            Single point of failure; no fault tolerance. Violates availability
            requirements for production deployments.
        - id: ALT-0001-B
          name: "OPT-RAFT: Raft for all events"
          rejected_reason: |
            Standard Raft is only CFT, not BFT. Fails security requirements for
            federated authority. Consensus overhead for observations is prohibitive.
        - id: ALT-0001-D
          name: "OPT-SIGNED-RAFT: Signed-Proof Raft (CFT + detection)"
          rejected_reason: |
            Detection-only byzantine logic is insufficient for Admission integrity.
            The system must remain safe under malicious validators, not merely detect them.
        - id: ALT-0001-C
          name: "OPT-FED: Federated signed chains with merge receipts"
          rejected_reason: |
            Weak ordering; requires complex merge adjudication. Higher operational
            complexity without proportional benefit for single-network operation.
      rationale:
        - "LAW-03: Control plane events require strict total ordering; data plane is commutative"
        - "LAW-10: Anti-entropy with declared merge operators for data plane"
        - "PHY-04: 'Reserve consensus for small control planes; prefer convergent replication'"
        - "BFT commitment ensures Admission integrity against malicious nodes"

      title: "LedgerBackend Trait Abstraction"

      decision: |
        Introduce a LedgerBackend trait that abstracts over storage backends (SQLite,
        consensus-backed) with async methods for append, read, and verification.
      rationale:
        - "Preserves backward compatibility with existing Ledger usage"
        - "Enables gradual migration via feature flags"
        - "Allows testing with in-memory or mock backends"
        - "Follows existing patterns in Reducer and Adapter traits"

      title: "Four-Tier Trust Hierarchy"
      status: DECIDED
      decision: |
        Establish four signer tiers: T0 (root/genesis), T1 (validators), T2 (holons),
        T3 (sessions). Each tier can only delegate to lower tiers. T0 actions require a
        3-of-5 Organisational Threshold Signature.
      rationale:
        - "Clear authority separation per existing OCAP model (LAW-05)"
        - "Genesis key (T0) isolated from network operations"
        - "Threshold signatures prevent single-entity root compromise"
        - "Validator keys (T1) support HSM integration"
        - "Actor/session keys (T2/T3) use existing KeyManager"
      trust_model: |
        TIER 0: ROOT AUTHORITY (3-of-5 Organisational entities)
          - Signs: Genesis block, validator set changes, emergency revocation
          - Rotation: Offline ceremony, multi-party (FROST/SSS)
          - Compromise: Network halt + new genesis

        TIER 1: VALIDATOR QUORUM (HSM Recommended)
          - Signs: Consensus proposals, block finalization
          - Rotation: KeyRotated event + quorum approval
          - Compromise: Slash + remove from validator set

        TIER 2: HOLON SIGNERS (KeyManager)
          - Signs: Events, leases, evidence
          - Rotation: KeyRotated event
          - Compromise: Revoke leases, quarantine

        TIER 3: SESSION SIGNERS (Ephemeral)
          - Signs: Tool requests, session events

      title: "Schema Registry with Fail-Closed Validation"
      status: DECIDED
      decision: |
        Implement a distributed schema registry where all nodes must agree on schema
        digests before accepting events. Unknown schemas trigger rejection (fail-closed).
      rationale:
        - "LAW-13 (Semantic Contracting): Events must be verifiable against contracts"
        - "Prevents silent data corruption from schema drift"
        - "Enables cross-version verification with canonicalizer tracking"

      title: "Event Classification by Ordering Guarantee"
      status: DECIDED
      decision: |
        Classify all kernel event types by required ordering guarantee (TotalOrder vs Eventual).
        Implement StrictlyOrderedEvidence rule: EvidencePublished events gating Admission
        MUST use TotalOrder. All LWW merges MUST use Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC).

        Use BLAKE3-based Merkle trees for efficient anti-entropy reconciliation.
        Nodes exchange tree digests to identify divergent ranges, then pull missing events.
      rationale:
        - "O(log n) sync complexity vs O(n) full scan"

      status: DECIDED
      decision: |
        Authority events include a quorum certificate containing 2f+1 validator signatures
        over the event hash, enabling independent verification.
      structure: |
        message QuorumCertificate {

          // Hash being certified
          bytes certified_hash = 3;

          // Consensus epoch and round
          uint64 epoch = 4;
          uint64 round = 5;

      rationale:

        All control plane messages between consensus nodes and relay holons MUST use
        mandatory padding or fixed-size frames to prevent information leakage via
        message timing or size analysis.
      rationale:

      title: "Capability Proof Model and Cross-Node Verification"
      status: DECIDED
      decision: |
        Introduce explicit capability lifecycle events to support cross-node verification.
        A capability proof is a delegation chain rooted in a CapabilityGranted event and
        optionally extended by CapabilityDelegated events, with revocation recorded via
        CapabilityRevoked. All capability events are TotalOrder authority events.
      rationale:
        - "DCS-REQ-0014 requires cross-node, ledger-verifiable authority"
        - "OCAP model demands explicit, auditable capability grants"
        - "Namespace binding prevents cross-namespace replay"
        - "Reuse Lease/LeaseScope for scope and budget semantics"
      proof_model:
        - "Proof includes ordered list of capability events (grant + delegation chain)"
