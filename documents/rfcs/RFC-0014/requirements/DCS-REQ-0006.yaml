  rationale: |
    Ledger history is the audit source of truth and must remain verifiable after migration.

  acceptance_criteria:

      description: "All pre-migration events remain verifiable post-migration"
      verification: "verify_chain passes after migration"
    - id: AC-002
      description: "No seq_id gaps introduced during migration"

    - id: AC-003
      description: "Rollback to single-node preserves all finalized events"
