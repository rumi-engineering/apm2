  title: "Hybrid Ordering Model"
  imported_from: null
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    The system MUST support two ordering guarantees: TotalOrder (BFT consensus) for
    control plane operations and Eventual (anti-entropy) for data plane observations.

  rationale: |
    Authority events require strict total order, while observation events can converge
    via CRDT merge to avoid consensus overhead.

      description: "Event metadata includes OrderingGuarantee enum"
      verification: "EventMetadata exposes TotalOrder/Eventual"

      verification: "Authority events require QC before finalization"
    - id: AC-003
      description: "Data plane events use CRDT merge operators"
      verification: "Anti-entropy applies merge operator per event type"
