  title: "Cross-Node Capability Verification"
  imported_from: null
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    Capabilities granted on any node MUST be verifiable by other nodes using
    ledger state and signature chains.

  rationale: |
    Distributed operation requires capability proofs to be portable and verifiable
    across nodes without trust in the granting node.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - id: AC-001
      description: "Capability proofs include signed delegation chain"
      verification: "Proof includes all delegations with signatures"
    - id: AC-002
      description: "Any node can verify capability via ledger state"
      verification: "Verification uses ledger state + signature chain"
    - id: AC-003
      description: "Invalid chains are rejected deterministically"
      verification: "Verification fails with consistent error"
    - id: AC-004
      description: "Capability proofs include namespace binding"
      verification: "Proof includes namespace; mismatch rejects verification"
