  title: "Outbound-Only Networking via Relay Holons"
  imported_from: null
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    Nodes behind NAT/firewall MUST participate via outbound-only reverse-TLS tunnels
    terminated at Relay Holons. Relay Holons are availability infrastructure and do not
    participate in consensus.

  rationale: |
    Outbound-only connectivity is required for secure containment while preserving
    participation in local quorums.

      verification: "Worker establishes reverse-TLS tunnel"

      verification: "Worker signatures verified end-to-end"

      description: "Relay downtime degrades availability but not safety"
      verification: "Consensus safety holds without relay"
