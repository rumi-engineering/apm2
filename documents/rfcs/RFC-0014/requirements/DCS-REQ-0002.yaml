  title: "Bootstrap Trust Root Immutability"
  imported_from: PRD-0007/REQ-0010
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    The network genesis and validator set MUST be established via an immutable trust
    root signed by an air-gapped authority key.

  rationale: |
    Genesis establishes the root of trust for the distributed ledger. It must be
    immutable and independently verifiable to prevent trust bootstrapping attacks.

      verification: "Confirm offline signing ceremony and key handling"
