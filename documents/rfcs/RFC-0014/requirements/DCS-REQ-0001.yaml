  statement: |
    All authority operations (promotions, capability grants, policy changes) MUST be
    reflected as signed kernel messages with total ordering guarantees provided by
    a BFT quorum (HotStuff/PBFT) at local-quorum scale.

  rationale: |
    Authority operations change the security posture of the system. They must be
    totally ordered to prevent race conditions and ensure deterministic state.
    Signatures provide non-repudiation and auditability.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - id: AC-001
      description: "Authority events committed only after consensus quorum (2f+1 of 3f+1)"
      verification: "Verify quorum certificate attached to authority events"

    - id: AC-002
      description: "Event sequence deterministically reproducible across nodes"
      verification: "Compare event logs across nodes; assert identical ordering"

    - id: AC-003
      description: "Quorum certificate attached to every authority event"
      verification: "Parse quorum_cert field; verify >= 2f+1 signatures"
