  title: "Anti-Entropy Reconciliation"
  imported_from: null
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    Data plane events MUST converge across nodes via periodic anti-entropy sync with
    declared merge operators and conflict recording (per LAW-10).

  rationale: |
    Eventual consistency enables high-volume observation replication without consensus.
