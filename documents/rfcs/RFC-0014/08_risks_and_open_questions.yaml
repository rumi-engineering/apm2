  risks:
    - id: RISK-0001
      name: "Consensus Library Selection"
      likelihood: MEDIUM
      impact: HIGH
      description: |
        The choice of BFT consensus implementation (custom HotStuff/PBFT variant or
        off-the-shelf library) significantly affects development time, security, and
        maintainability. Wrong choice may require rewrite.
      mitigation:
        - "Evaluate existing Rust BFT consensus libraries or frameworks"
        - "Prototype with abstraction layer to enable swap"
        - "Prioritize libraries with formal verification or extensive production use"
        - "Plan for at least 2 weeks of library evaluation before commitment"
      residual_risk: "Library may have undiscovered bugs; maintain abstraction for swap"
      owner: "Architect"

    - id: RISK-0002
      name: "Network Protocol Complexity"
      likelihood: MEDIUM
      impact: MEDIUM
      description: |
        Distributed consensus introduces network protocol complexity (message
        ordering, retries, timeouts) that may cause subtle bugs.
      mitigation:
        - "Use deterministic simulation testing (Jepsen-style)"
        - "Implement comprehensive fault injection tests"
        - "Start with leader-based replication (simpler) before full consensus"
        - "Document all network protocol state machines"
      residual_risk: "Edge cases in partition scenarios may emerge in production"
      owner: "Engineer"

    - id: RISK-0003
      name: "Performance Degradation"
      likelihood: MEDIUM
      impact: MEDIUM
      description: |
        Consensus adds latency to control plane operations. If latency is too
        high, it may affect user experience or system responsiveness.
      mitigation:
        - "Benchmark early and often"
        - "Optimize critical path (pre-prepare → commit)"
        - "Pipeline proposals when possible"
        - "Keep consensus for control plane only (data plane uses anti-entropy)"
      residual_risk: "Geo-distributed deployments may have higher latency"
      owner: "Engineer"

    - id: RISK-0004
      name: "HSM Integration Complexity"
      likelihood: LOW
      impact: MEDIUM
      description: |
        HSM integration for T1 keys may introduce vendor-specific complexity
        and operational overhead.
      mitigation:
        - "Define abstract HSM interface; implement software fallback first"
        - "Choose HSM with good Rust SDK (e.g., YubiHSM)"
        - "Plan for HSM-specific testing environment"
        - "Document key ceremony procedures"
      residual_risk: "HSM hardware failures may require manual intervention"
      owner: "Security"

    - id: RISK-0005
      name: "Migration Data Loss"
      likelihood: LOW
      impact: CRITICAL
      description: |
        Migration from single-node to distributed mode may introduce bugs
        that corrupt or lose historical data.
      mitigation:
        - "Mandatory backup before migration"
        - "Migration runs in dry-run mode first"
        - "Verify hash chain before and after"
        - "Documented rollback procedure tested in staging"
      residual_risk: "Rollback may lose post-migration events"
      owner: "Operations"

    - id: RISK-0006
      name: "Validator Key Compromise"
      likelihood: LOW
      impact: HIGH
      description: |
        Compromise of a validator key allows attacker to participate in
        consensus with one vote.
      mitigation:
        - "HSM storage for T1 keys"
        - "Regular key rotation (quarterly)"
        - "Rapid revocation via governance vote"
        - "Monitoring for unusual signing patterns"
      residual_risk: "Attacker has one vote; cannot unilaterally finalize"
      owner: "Security"

    - id: RISK-0007
      name: "Anti-Entropy Divergence"
      likelihood: MEDIUM
      impact: LOW
      description: |
        Data plane events may diverge significantly between nodes if
        anti-entropy sync is slow or merge conflicts are frequent.
      mitigation:
        - "Tune sync frequency based on event rate"
        - "Monitor conflict rate; alert on high divergence"
        - "Record all conflicts as DefectRecorded events for analysis"
        - "Prioritize CRDT-friendly event designs"
      residual_risk: "Temporary inconsistency in non-authority data"
      owner: "Engineer"

    - id: RISK-0008
      name: "Relay Holon Compromise"
      likelihood: LOW
      impact: MEDIUM
      description: |
        An attacker compromises a Relay Holon and attempts to intercept or drop
        messages between workers and the consensus network.
      mitigation:
        - "mTLS ensures relay cannot spoof identity of workers"
        - "End-to-end signature verification of consensus proposals"
        - "Redundant relays; workers can fail over to secondary relays"
        - "Relay capabilities strictly limited to NAT traversal"
      residual_risk: "Denial of service for workers behind the compromised relay"
      owner: "Security"

  open_questions:
    - id: Q-0001
      question: "Which consensus library should we use?"
      status: PENDING_SPIKE
      context: |
        Options include:
        - BFT libraries or frameworks with HotStuff/PBFT semantics
        - Custom implementation
        Each has different trade-offs in maturity, features, and maintenance.
      proposed_resolution: |
        Conduct 2-week evaluation with prototype of each option (DCS-007a). Criteria:
        - API compatibility with LedgerBackend
        - Testing infrastructure quality
        - Byzantine fault tolerance (required)
        - Maintenance and community activity
        Spike exit criteria:
        - Select a library OR commit to custom implementation
        - Document rationale and known limitations
        - Provide minimal integration plan for DCS-007b/c/d

      decision_deadline: "Before DCS-007b implementation"

    - id: Q-0002
      question: "Which BFT protocol variant should we use (HotStuff vs PBFT)?"
      status: PENDING_SPIKE
      context: |
        Both HotStuff and PBFT satisfy BFT safety/liveness at local quorum scale,
        but differ in message complexity, implementation complexity, and available
        Rust libraries.
      proposed_resolution: |
        Evaluate HotStuff and PBFT variants during DCS-007a spike. Select based on:
        - Message complexity vs latency at 4-7 nodes
        - Availability of reference implementations or libraries
        - Ease of QC integration and evidence export
        Spike exit criteria:
        - Choose HotStuff or PBFT variant for v1
        - Record the message types and phase transitions
        - Map to evidence artifacts EVID-0007 and EVID-0008

    - id: Q-0003
      question: "How should namespace-to-quorum mapping work?"
      status: OPEN
      context: |
        Options:
        - One BFT quorum per namespace (fine-grained but many groups)
        - One BFT quorum for all control plane (simple but potential bottleneck)
        - Hierarchical grouping (complex)
      proposed_resolution: |
        Start with single BFT quorum for all control plane. Add namespace
        sharding only if performance requires. Monitor proposal rate to
        determine if sharding is needed.

    - id: Q-0004
      question: "What is the minimum validator set size for production?"
      status: OPEN
      context: |
        Trade-off between fault tolerance and operational complexity:
        - 4 nodes (f=1): Simple but marginal fault tolerance
        - 7 nodes (f=2): Better tolerance but more operational overhead
        - More nodes: Diminishing returns on tolerance
      proposed_resolution: |
        Recommend 4 nodes for small deployments, 7 for production.
        Document trade-offs and let operators choose.

    - id: Q-0005
      question: "How should T0 key ceremony be conducted?"
      status: OPEN
      context: |
        T0 (root) key is critical infrastructure. Ceremony must balance
        security (multi-party, air-gapped) with practicality.
      proposed_resolution: |
        Define ceremony protocol with:
        - 3-of-5 threshold signing
        - Air-gapped signing machine
        - Witnessed by multiple stakeholders
        - Video recording of ceremony
        Document as operational procedure.

    - id: Q-0006
      question: "Should we support cross-network federation in this RFC?"
      status: RESOLVED
      resolution: |
        No. Cross-network federation (multiple independent APM2 networks
        with different genesis blocks) is out of scope for this RFC.
        A future RFC will address federation.

    - id: Q-0007
      question: "What merge operators should we support initially?"
      status: RESOLVED
      resolution: |
        Initial set:
        - LastWriterWins (LWW): For SessionProgress, ToolExecuted
        - SetUnion: For EvidencePublished, SessionCrashDetected
        - NoMerge: For control plane events (conflict = defect)
        Additional operators can be added as needed.
