  title: "Reviewer viability (workspace snapshot/apply + minimal tools)"
  statement: |
    Reviewer episodes must receive a workspace snapshot/apply input derived from
    ChangeSetBundleV1, execute a minimal approved tool set (FileRead +
    GitOperation{DIFF, STATUS} + ArtifactFetch; ListFiles/Search is NEW WORK
    REQUIRED via TCK-00315), and store review outputs/logs in CAS with
    ledger-anchored receipts. ShellExec is forbidden by default and requires
    explicit capability allowlist.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Workspace snapshot/apply succeeds for valid bundles; failures emit ReviewBlocked with CAS logs."
    - "Reviewer tool execution logs are stored in CAS and referenced by ReviewReceipt."
    - "Tool profile is enforced; unallowlisted tools are denied."
