  title: "Reviewer lifecycle telemetry and bounded projection visibility"
  statement: |
    FAC review execution MUST emit append-only lifecycle telemetry and bounded projection
    summaries suitable for operator and gate monitoring without transcript dependence.

    Telemetry MUST include explicit error/fallback/stall/SHA-drift reason codes and support
    bounded-rate projection for CI log surfaces.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00444.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Lifecycle telemetry is append-only and machine-parseable with deterministic event typing."
    - "Projection logs emit bounded-rate status lines plus explicit error-event lines."
    - "Operator monitoring can derive reviewer liveness and terminal states from telemetry alone."
    - "Telemetry gaps or malformed events fail closed for authoritative gate projection."
