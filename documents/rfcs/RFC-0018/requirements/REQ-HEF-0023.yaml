  type: "SECURITY"
  title: "Credential-surface hardening and PAT-free projection operation"
  statement: |
    FAC review and projection surfaces MUST avoid persistent PAT dependence and MUST prevent
    reviewer credential exposure through process arguments, logs, or unbounded environment propagation.

    Runtime command execution MUST keep sensitive credential material out of argv and enforce
    deny-by-default behavior when credential posture is ambiguous.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00445.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Projection path operates without PAT secrets in normal FAC operation."
    - "Sensitive credential values are not present in process argv or projected logs."
    - "Credential source ambiguity blocks authoritative projection and emits structured defects."
    - "Security checks verify hardened command invocation patterns in FAC workflow execution."
