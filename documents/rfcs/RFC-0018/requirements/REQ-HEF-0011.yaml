  title: "ReviewBlocked liveness semantics"
  statement: |
    ReviewBlocked must be a ledger-anchored outcome with explicit reason codes
    (including BINARY_UNSUPPORTED, MISSING_ARTIFACT, INVALID_BUNDLE, TIMEOUT)
    and CAS logs. Retries are bounded by HTF windows; blocked outcomes are
    durable receipts for liveness failures.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "ReviewBlockedRecorded is emitted for apply/tool failures with reason_code and CAS log hash."
    - "Retries are bounded by MonotonicTicks windows; blocked outcomes persist in ledger."
