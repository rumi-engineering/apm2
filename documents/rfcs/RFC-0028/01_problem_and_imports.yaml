    one_line: "Define a fail-closed external I/O security profile over RFC-0027 PCAC lifecycle semantics without redefining PCAC."
    thesis: |
      RFC-0028 exists because lifecycle correctness alone is insufficient for
      adversarial external I/O. Promotion-critical authority flow must satisfy a
      security profile that is explicit, replay-verifiable, and fail-closed.

      The profile imports RFC-0027 lifecycle semantics and RFC-0019 snapshot
      baseline contracts, then constrains admission via security predicates,
      gates, and evidence obligations.

  problem_statement:
    primary: |
      PCAC lifecycle semantics require a security-plane profile that blocks
      ambiguous, stale, unverifiable, or downgraded authority states in
      promotion-critical paths.

      Without RFC-0028 profile constraints, external I/O can admit lifecycle-
      shaped claims that still violate identity freshness, revocation dominance,
      delegation exactness, boundary-flow controls, projection isolation,
      compromise containment, or temporal ambiguity handling.
    why_now:
      - "External I/O is adversarial by default and requires explicit fail-closed security gates."
      - "RFC-0027 defines lifecycle semantics but does not encode full profile-level security constraints."
      - "RFC-0019 snapshot/gate sequencing requires profile-conformant security-plane admission."
