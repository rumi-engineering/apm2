  category: "CODE_AND_TEST"
  status: "STUB"
  description: |
    Evidence that quarantine lifecycle is hardened with priority-aware eviction,
    saturation-safe insertion (deny when full), per-session quota isolation,
    restart-safe persistence for fail-closed tiers, and durable capacity guard
    preventing post-effect 'cannot quarantine' states.
  requirement_ids:
    - "REQ-0004"
  expected_contents:
    - "Active unexpired high-severity quarantines are never evicted by lower priority entries."
    - "Quarantine saturation causes deny when quarantine is mandatory."
    - "Per-session quota prevents cross-session starvation."
    - "Quarantine state persists across restart for fail-closed tiers."
    - "Durable capacity guard prevents 'cannot quarantine later' for fail-closed tiers."
    - "Adversarial flood + restart tests exist and pass in CI."
