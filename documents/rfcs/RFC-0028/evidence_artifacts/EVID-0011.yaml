  description: |
    Evidence that daemon-instrumented witnesses are required for fail-closed tiers,
    witness seeds are bound into AJC join inputs (seed-at-join), post-effect witness
    evidence is materialized and bound into AdmissionBundleV1 (evidence-post-effect),
    and witness provider provenance is committed into seed objects.
  requirement_ids:
    - "REQ-0004"
  expected_contents:
    - "Fail-closed tiers deny on missing witness seeds at join."
    - "Fail-closed tiers deny output release on missing post-effect witness evidence."
    - "Witness seed hashes are bound into AJC join input and referenced in AdmissionBundle."
    - "Post-effect evidence hashes/refs are in AdmissionBundle."
    - "Witness provider identity/version is committed into seed objects."
    - "Monitor tiers use explicit waiver binding (no silent permissive defaults)."
