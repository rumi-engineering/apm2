    - id: "RSK-SIO28-0001"
      title: "Stop/revoke temporal fallback misuse"
      statement: |
        Emergency temporal fallback can become unsafe if used beyond its
        constrained carve-out when full envelope validity is unavailable.
      mitigation: |
        v0.4 constrains fallback to local emergency monotonic-time proof for
        authority-reduction stop/revoke paths only, and denies all
        authority-expansion paths during fallback operation.
      status: "MITIGATED"

    - id: "RSK-SIO28-0002"
      title: "Delegation depth and satisfiability underbounded"
      statement: |
        Exact-meet delegation remains unsafe if deep chains or expensive
        satisfiability checks are admitted without explicit bounds.
      mitigation: |
        v0.4 introduces delegation_max_depth and
        delegation_satisfiability_budget_ticks; overflow or budget exhaustion is
        non-admissible.
      status: "MITIGATED"

    - id: "RSK-SIO28-0003"
      title: "Evidence liveness under S3 freeze"
      statement: |
        Strict freeze can starve recovery if no bounded pathway exists to
        regenerate evidence or restore temporal authority.
      mitigation: |
        v0.4 allows bounded evidence-regeneration/time-authority-recovery
        workflows in S3 that cannot authorize new external effects.
      status: "MITIGATED"

    - id: "RSK-SIO28-0004"
      title: "Trade-secret posture versus redundancy recoverability"
      statement: |
        Redundancy recoverability needs controlled declassification, which can
        conflict with hard disclosure constraints if not explicitly scoped.
      mitigation: |
        v0.4 introduces redundancy_purpose_declassification with mandatory
        receipts and explicit prohibition on exposing authority-bearing plaintext
        semantics beyond required fragment metadata.
      status: "MITIGATED"

    - id: "RSK-SIO28-0005"
      title: "Probabilistic detection and stress outcomes"
      statement: |
        Detection latency and adversarial stress outcomes are probabilistic and
        cannot be treated as absolute guarantees.
      mitigation: |
        Require confidence metadata, statistical power declarations, and evidence
        freshness SLAs for promotion-critical claims.
      status: "OPEN"

    - id: "RSK-SIO28-0006"
      title: "Supported-envelope boundary"
      statement: |
        Only tested federation/adversary envelopes are promotable; claims beyond
        tested envelope remain non-authoritative.
      mitigation: |
        Admit expanded envelope claims only after new evidence receipts are
        produced and accepted.
      status: "OPEN"

  claim_classification:
    absolute_claims:
      - "Unknown or ambiguous authority-critical states fail closed."
      - "Delegation widening is never admissible."
    probabilistic_claims:
      - "Detection latency is probabilistic and must carry confidence metadata."
      - "Adversarial stress outcomes are probabilistic and must carry sample-plan and freshness metadata."

  supported_envelope:
    promotable_rule: "Only tested federation and adversary envelopes are promotable."
    non_authoritative_rule: "Claims beyond tested envelopes remain non-authoritative until new evidence receipts are admitted."
