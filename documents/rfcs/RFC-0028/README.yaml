  title: "Holonic External I/O Security Profile over PCAC"
  summary: |
    RFC-0028 defines the security profile for external holonic I/O on top of
    RFC-0027 PCAC lifecycle semantics. It imports the RFC-0019 PCAC snapshot
    baseline and enforces stage-specific fail-closed security constraints.

    RFC-0028 does not redefine PCAC semantics; it defines profile-level gates,
    requirements, and evidence for security conformance.
    This revision formalizes lifecycle threat algebra, exact-meet delegation
    determinism, cryptographic agility and downgrade resistance, key-compromise
    response windows, split-brain revocation behavior, and projection-sink
    identity hardening (including key-rotation and DNS-hijack containment).
    Trade-secret-only controls and direct-GitHub authority elimination remain
    hard non-regressible constraints. Temporal admission remains HTF-authorized
    and fail-closed via `TP-EIO29-*` interoperability anchors.
