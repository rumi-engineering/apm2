  title: "Delegation meet and no-bypass actuation closure"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Delegated authority MUST be admitted only when delegated authority equals
    the strict-subset meet across authority dimensions, computed by deterministic
    canonical algorithm `delegation_meet_exact_v1`; and all actuation paths MUST
    traverse broker, capability, and context-firewall checks.
  rationale: |
    Delegation correctness is invalid if any side-effect path bypasses enforcement.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Delegation widening attempts are denied at all tested recursion depths."
    - "Independent verifier recomputation of meet output matches canonical meet digest for admitted delegations."
    - "Missing enforcement dependency causes deny-by-default, never permissive fallback."
    - "No adapter/runtime profile can produce unmediated actuation."
