  title: "Boundary intent typing and acceptance-fact separation"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    External interaction channels MUST classify boundary intents (`Observe`, `Assert`,
    `Delegate`, `Actuate`, `Govern`) and prevent lower-assurance classes from being
    consumed as authoritative acceptance facts.
  rationale: |
    Ambiguous intent semantics permit authority confusion and covert privilege escalation.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Observe-class data cannot directly satisfy authoritative admission predicates."
    - "Assert/Delegate/Actuate decisions require receipt-bound acceptance facts."
    - "Boundary intent type is recorded and replay-verifiable for every external interaction."
