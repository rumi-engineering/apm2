  title: "Public projection compromise detection and containment"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Compromise of public projection surfaces (for example GitHub repository takeover,
    unauthorized state mutation, or projection endpoint forgery) MUST be detected as
    divergence against CAS+ledger-derived expected projection state.

    Authoritative FAC decisions MUST remain pinned to CAS+ledger trust roots and MUST
    continue when projection channels are quarantined. Projection channels MUST be
    replay-recoverable from durable receipts after compromise adjudication.

    Promotion-critical compromise handling MUST resolve temporal authority via
    signed `TimeAuthorityEnvelopeV1` and declared HTF window references.
    Unknown/stale/missing/invalid temporal authority MUST fail closed.
    Canonical temporal predicates for this requirement are `TP-EIO29-001`
    and `TP-EIO29-008`.
  rationale: |
    Public projection compromise is expected at scale and must not propagate into
    authority paths or local source-of-truth decisions.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Projection divergence detection emits structured defects with digest-bound evidence."
    - "Compromised projection channels are quarantined without halting authoritative FAC progression."
    - "Authoritative admission and gate decisions remain derivable from CAS+ledger only."
    - "Projection state can be reconstructed from trusted receipts after containment."
    - "Compromise and quarantine decisions include signed time_authority_ref and window_ref fields."
    - "Temporal-authority ambiguity in compromise flows fails closed."
