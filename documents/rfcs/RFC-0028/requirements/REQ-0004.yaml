  title: "Context integrity, dual-lattice propagation, and declassification receipts"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Boundary interactions MUST preserve context integrity and dual-lattice taint/confidentiality
    semantics end-to-end. Confidentiality downgrade MUST require explicit declassification policy
    and receipt emission.
  rationale: |
    Non-continuous taint/confidentiality propagation creates covert authority and exfiltration paths.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Out-of-pack or TOCTOU-violating context access denies."
    - "Tier3+ actuators reject untrusted or over-confidential inputs by policy."
    - "No boundary downgrade occurs without declassification receipt."
