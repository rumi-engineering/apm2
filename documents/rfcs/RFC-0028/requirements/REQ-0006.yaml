  title: "Downgrade resistance and adversarial economic fail-closed posture"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Boundary protocol negotiation and parser/canonicalization behavior MUST resist downgrade
    and malformed-input coercion. Under adversarial cost pressure, enforcement MUST fail closed
    and preserve containment precedence over liveness.
  rationale: |
    Economic and downgrade attacks turn partial enforcement into unsafe permissive behavior.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Tier2+ contract/canonicalizer mismatch denies by default."
    - "Unknown/invalid enum and bounded-decoding violations deny with structured defects."
    - "Budget exhaustion cannot force permissive acceptance of authoritative claims."
