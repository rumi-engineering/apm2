  title: "Portable acceptance evidence and deterministic third-party reverification"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Authoritative external claims MUST be backed by portable, receipt-addressed evidence
    that independent counterparties can deterministically re-verify without ambient state.
  rationale: |
    Boundary trust cannot rely on one implementation's private state or interpretation.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Acceptance evidence can be independently re-verified across at least two verifier implementations."
    - "Portable replay package includes all required receipt pointers and verification metadata."
    - "Unverifiable imported authority claims are denied."
