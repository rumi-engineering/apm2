  title: "Disclosure-control policy interlock (default trade-secret-only mode)"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    External-I/O security profile enforcement MUST bind authoritative effects to a
    signed disclosure-control policy mode. Current policy default is
    `TRADE_SECRET_ONLY` for strategic mechanisms.

    Policy mode MUST be phase-qualified by `phase_disclosure_profile(phase_id)`.
    Early pre-federation phases MAY enforce `TRADE_SECRET_ONLY`; later
    replication-oriented phases MAY permit selective disclosure only via signed,
    receipted declassification controls.

    Any policy mode transition (including patent-allowing modes) is non-admissible
    until explicitly authorized by signed policy epoch transition evidence and
    equivalent boundary-containment controls.

    Unknown, stale, missing, or ambiguous disclosure-control state MUST deny
    authoritative effects.
  rationale: |
    Disclosure posture is a governance policy decision, while containment enforcement
    is a hard security mechanism. The mechanism must remain strict even if posture
    mode changes.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Policy mode is hash-bound to gate decisions for all promotion-critical effects."
    - "Active policy mode matches phase_disclosure_profile(phase_id) for the evaluated window."
    - "In `TRADE_SECRET_ONLY` mode, patent/provisional workflow attempts are denied and emit structured security defects."
    - "Unapproved disclosure channel classes cannot pass boundary admission."
    - "Tier2+ authoritative effects fail closed when trade-secret control evidence is missing or stale."
    - "Disclosure-control policy snapshot hash is bound to gate decision evidence."
