  schema_version: "2026-02-09"

  title: "Proof-carrying identity, freshness, and revocation authority closure"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Tier2+ external authority admission MUST require proof-carrying identity membership,
    HTF-compatible freshness authority, and revocation dominance under partition/rejoin.
    Missing, stale, conflicting, or unverifiable identity/freshness state MUST deny.
  rationale: |
    Authentic identity without freshness and revocation closure is insufficient at adversarial boundaries.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Tier2+ admissions fail closed on stale or ambiguous identity head state."
    - "Revoked identity/delegation acceptance converges to zero within bounded anti-entropy windows."
    - "No wall-time-based authorization semantics for identity freshness."
