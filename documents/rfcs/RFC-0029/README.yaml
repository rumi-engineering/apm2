  title: "Holonic External I/O Efficiency Profile over PCAC"
  summary: |
    RFC-0029 defines the efficiency/economics profile for external holonic I/O on
    top of RFC-0027 PCAC lifecycle semantics. It imports the RFC-0019 PCAC snapshot
    baseline and enforces stage-aware economics with security interlock constraints.

    RFC-0029 does not redefine PCAC semantics; it defines profile-level gates,
    requirements, and evidence for efficiency conformance.
    This revision formalizes temporal window algebra and evaluator semantics for
    all `TP-EIO29-*` predicates, degraded-mode and halt-risk budgets, overload
    admission-control and anti-starvation math, multi-sink Byzantine continuity
    assumptions, split-brain revocation monotonicity, and stronger inter-RFC
    semantic drift fail-closed behavior.
    The profile preserves hard non-regression constraints for trade-secret posture
    and projection-authority isolation while tightening evidence quality, physical
    failure assumptions, and attacker-adaptation economics.
