      rule: "Execute independent gate families in parallel groups and merge by fail-dominant reduction."
      groups:
        - group_id: "A"
          gates: "temporal authority + drift"

          gates: "projection continuity + projection isolation"

    authority_path_redundancy:
      - "At least two independent time-authority verifier families for Tier2+."
      - "Independent projection worker pools with non-overlapping failure domains."
      - "Independent replay verifiers for reconstruction admissibility."

    evidence_budget_backpressure:
      - "evidence_budget_profile declares max verification overhead per window."
      - "When evidence workload threatens control-lane tick floors, enter constrained degrade mode instead of silently dropping controls."

    promotion_gate_cost_model:
      latency_decomposition:
        - "T_gate_total = T_schema_resolve + T_canonicalizer_check + T_signature_freshness + T_digest_validation + T_predicate_eval"
        - "Total promotion decision latency is fail-dominant aggregation across required gates."
        - "T_cascade_total = T_gate_total + T_evidence_generation + T_adjudication_overhead"
      mandatory_evidence_backed_feasibility_claims:
        - "Declare profile target bounds for p50/p95/p99(T_gate_total) under representative load."
        - "Declare p50/p95/p99(T_evidence_generation) for promotion-critical evidence classes."
        - "Include amortization policy for reusable verification artifacts across adjacent promotion attempts."
        - "Include fail-fast ordering evidence minimizing wasted downstream gate work after early deny."

      non_admissible_rule: "Promotion is non-admissible when measured observables violate declared thresholds, even if point-in-time safety predicates pass."

  assumptions_and_defaults:
    - "Pre-live status allows semantic tightening without backward-compatibility overhead unless a concrete dependency explicitly requires compatibility."
    - "Dominance order remains containment/security > verification/correctness > liveness/progress."
    - "All unknown or ambiguous authority-critical inputs are fail-closed."

  migration_plan:
    status: "ACTIVE"
    note: |
      RFC-0029 implementation planning now tracks explicit execution tickets in
      `06_ticket_decomposition.yaml`. Migration focuses on phased rollout with
      gate-evidence backfill and quantitative quality/freshness obligations.
