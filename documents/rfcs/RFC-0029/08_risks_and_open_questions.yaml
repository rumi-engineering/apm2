    - id: "RSK-EIO29-0001"
      title: "Emergency-time carve-out misuse in stop/revoke lane"
      statement: |
        The local_monotonic_emergency_time_valid carve-out can be misapplied to
        authorize non-reduction operations when full envelope validity is
        unavailable.
      mitigation: |
        Restrict carve-out to stop/revoke lane authority-reduction actions only;
        deny all authority-expansion paths and require explicit gate evidence for
        carve-out usage.
      status: "OPEN"

    - id: "RSK-EIO29-0002"
      title: "Correlated temporal disagreement and evidence freshness liveness pressure"
      statement: |
        Sustained temporal disagreement with concurrent evidence freshness decay
        can increase freeze cascades and delay recovery to D0.
      mitigation: |
        Enforce adjudication deadlines, prioritized bounded evidence regeneration,
        and throughput-dominance recovery targets while maintaining no-authority-
        expansion constraints in degraded modes.
      status: "OPEN"

    - id: "RSK-EIO29-0003"
      title: "Disclosure policy versus redundancy placement tension"
      statement: |
        Required redundancy fragment placement may conflict with active
        disclosure-control mode constraints, causing recoverability plan
        infeasibility.
      mitigation: |
        Require redundancy_purpose_declassification_valid scoped receipts;
        otherwise constrain redundancy plans to trust-boundary-local placement or
        deny promotion-critical admissibility.
      status: "OPEN"

    - id: "RSK-EIO29-0004"
      title: "Joint-state comparator drift across profiles"
      statement: |
        Divergent interpretation of mode_dominance_select across security and
        efficiency profiles can produce inconsistent (S_i, D_j) arbitration
        outcomes.
      mitigation: |
        Keep typed comparator contract centralized, emit arbitration receipts,
        and fail closed on unresolved comparator state.
      status: "OPEN"

    - id: "RSK-EIO29-0005"
      title: "Unbounded gate-cascade and evidence generation envelope"
      statement: |
        T_cascade_total feasibility relative to evidence TTL may be optimistic
        until measured under representative stress and degradation conditions.
      mitigation: |
        Require measured p50/p95/p99 targets for T_gate_total and
        T_evidence_generation plus proof that T_cascade_total remains below
        promotion-critical evidence TTL bounds.
      status: "OPEN"

    - id: "RSK-EIO29-0006"
      title: "Probabilistic queue and attacker-cost guarantees"
      statement: |
        Queue latency/recovery envelopes and attacker-cost asymmetry bounds are
        probabilistic and can be misread as absolute safety guarantees.
      mitigation: |
        Bind confidence intervals and sample-size contracts into evidence quality
        profiles and deny optimization when confidence minima are unresolved.
      status: "OPEN"

    - id: "RSK-EIO29-0007"
      title: "Supported-envelope overreach"
      statement: |
        Promotion claims beyond tested federation size/geography/adversary
        profiles are non-authoritative and may exceed validated bounds.
      mitigation: |
        Block promotion beyond declared stress-tested envelope until new evidence
        receipts are admitted for expanded profiles.
