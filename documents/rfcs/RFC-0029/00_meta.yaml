        phase: "IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKING"
        notes: |
          Corrected YAML/markdown profile-identity alignment, closed requirement
          import drift, added quantitative evidence contracts, added control-
          theory and leakage-budget governance sections, and populated executable
          ticket decomposition with concrete RFC-0029 ticket bindings.

        notes: |
          Enriched metadata and decomposition baseline for RFC-0029 profile
          definition. No runtime behavior changes are introduced by this
          metadata revision.
