    thesis: |
      RFC-0029 exists to constrain optimization and cost reduction under explicit
      security/correctness invariants. Efficiency gains are admissible only when
      lifecycle closure, temporal authority, revocation monotonicity, replay
      idempotency, and boundary isolation remain non-regressed.

      The profile imports RFC-0027 lifecycle semantics, RFC-0019 snapshot/gate
      baseline contracts, and companion constraints across RFC-0016/RFC-0018/
      RFC-0020/RFC-0021/RFC-0028.

  problem_statement:
    primary: |
      External I/O requires economics-aware admission and queue/recovery behavior,
      but optimization pressure can induce unsafe shortcuts. Without a formal
      efficiency profile, implementations may reduce cost while weakening temporal
      contracts, replay closure, disclosure posture, or authority containment.

      RFC-0029 defines machine-checkable temporal predicates (`TP-EIO29-*`),
      degraded-mode economics, queue/backpressure invariants, and gate-bound CAC
      contracts so efficiency remains fail-closed under adversarial conditions.
    why_now:
      - "Promotion-critical external I/O needs bounded queue/recovery economics aligned with HTF windows."
      - "Cross-profile composition with RFC-0028 requires explicit efficiency-plane constraints and arbitration contracts."
      - "Evidence freshness and gate cascade costs must be bounded before implementation hardening."
