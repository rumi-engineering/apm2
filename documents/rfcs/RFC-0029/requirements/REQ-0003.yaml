  title: "Verification amortization and proof-cache discipline"
  category: "NON_FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Boundary verification pipelines MUST amortize repeated work through batching,
    deduplicated proof paths, and bounded cache reuse without reducing assurance.
  rationale: |
    Linear-growth verification costs make high-volume operation non-viable.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Repeated admissions reuse proof artifacts where safe and policy-allowed."
    - "Verifier workload growth is sub-linear for targeted correlated workloads."
    - "Cache invalidation preserves freshness and revocation correctness."
