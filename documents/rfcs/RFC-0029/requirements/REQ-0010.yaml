  title: "Tiered erasure+BFT reconstruction admissibility for authoritative source recovery"
  category: "RELIABILITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Mandatory authoritative artifact tiers (source snapshots, policy roots,
    promotion-critical evidence manifests) MUST be reconstructable from declared
    erasure profiles and MUST require BFT quorum certification over recovered
    digests before promotion-critical use.

    Reconstruction admissibility MUST include `RecoveryAdmissibilityReceiptV1`
    carrying `time_authority_ref`, `window_ref`, `digest_proof_ref`, and
    `quorum_cert_ref`.
    Canonical temporal predicates for this requirement are `TP-EIO29-001`
    and `TP-EIO29-004`.

    Recovered state is admissible only when recovered digest matches trusted
    SourceTrustSnapshot bindings (CAS root + ledger head + policy signatures).
  rationale: |
    Recovery without quorum-validated integrity allows silent corruption and
    Byzantine acceptance. Reconstruction must be both available and trustworthy.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Corruption/loss drills reconstruct mandatory tiers within declared envelopes."
    - "Reconstruction requires valid BFT quorum certificate over recovered digest."
    - "Digest mismatch against SourceTrustSnapshot blocks promotion-critical use."
    - "Recovery admissibility receipts are HTF-bound with signed time authority and window references."
    - "Missing recovery proof components fail closed."
