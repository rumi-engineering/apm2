  title: "Canonical boundary economics profile"
  category: "NON_FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    External interaction paths MUST evaluate budget admissibility via a canonical
    economics profile parameterized by risk tier and interaction class.
  rationale: |
    Without one profile surface, budget decisions are inconsistent and non-reproducible.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Admission decisions expose profile inputs/outputs deterministically."
    - "Policy explains budget allowance/denial per interaction class."
    - "Unprofiled authoritative paths deny by default."
