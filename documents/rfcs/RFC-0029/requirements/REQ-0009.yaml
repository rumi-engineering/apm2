  title: "Projection multi-sink outage continuity and deferred replay boundedness"
  category: "RELIABILITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    FAC authoritative progression MUST remain admissible for outage scenarios
    bounded by `ProjectionContinuityWindowV1.outage_window_ref` when public
    projection sinks (for example GitHub) are unavailable, rate-limited,
    banned, adversarially divergent, or churned.

    Projection intents MUST be durably buffered from ledger truth events and
    replayed idempotently after sink recovery within
    `ProjectionContinuityWindowV1.replay_window_ref`.

    Gate admissibility MUST require valid signed `TimeAuthorityEnvelopeV1` and
    fail closed on stale/unsigned/missing/invalid temporal authority.
    Canonical temporal predicates for this requirement are `TP-EIO29-001`,
    `TP-EIO29-003`, `TP-EIO29-004`, and `TP-EIO29-005`.
  rationale: |
    Public projection systems are availability-variable by nature. External sink
    failure cannot be allowed to halt truth-plane continuity.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Authoritative FAC decisions remain derivable from CAS+ledger truth plane only, independent of projection sink state."
    - "Continuity drills across multi-sink failure/churn scenarios show uninterrupted authoritative FAC progression for the full declared outage window."
    - "Deferred projection replay converges idempotently within declared replay windows after sink recovery."
    - "Backlog growth remains within declared retention and replay windows."
    - "Time-authority denial tests cover missing/stale/invalid-signature/boundary-mismatch envelopes."
    - "Unknown continuity/replay/temporal-authority state fails closed for promotion gates."
