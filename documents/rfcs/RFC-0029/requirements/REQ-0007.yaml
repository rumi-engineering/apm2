  title: "Disclosure-control interlock non-regression for optimization paths"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Efficiency optimizations MUST preserve disclosure-control policy constraints.
    Current default policy mode is `TRADE_SECRET_ONLY`.

    Optimization decisions MUST bind to `phase_disclosure_profile(phase_id)` for
    the evaluated window; optimizations that assume a disclosure mode not active
    for the current phase are non-admissible.

    No optimization path may weaken fail-closed behavior when disclosure-control
    evidence is unknown, stale, missing, or ambiguous, regardless of policy mode.
    Any policy mode transition is non-admissible without signed policy epoch
    transition evidence and explicit interlock validation.
  rationale: |
    Economics improvements are invalid if they reduce confidentiality posture or
    create irreversible strategic disclosure channels.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Optimization gate denies any proposal that regresses disclosure-control predicates."
    - "Optimization gate denies phase/policy mode mismatches for disclosure posture."
    - "In `TRADE_SECRET_ONLY` mode, patent/provisional workflow attempts remain blocked."
    - "Disclosure-channel classification remains deny-by-default for unapproved classes."
    - "Gate evidence binds optimization decisions to disclosure-control policy snapshot hashes."
