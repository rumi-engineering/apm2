  title: "Digest-first control plane and selector completeness"
  category: "NON_FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Supervisory and federation-facing control planes MUST be digest-first with
    selector/loss-profile completeness sufficient for deterministic zoom-in and replay.
  rationale: |
    Transcript-first surfaces do not scale and impair deterministic reverification.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Control-plane APIs operate from summaries/selectors without raw transcript transfer by default."
    - "High-risk claims include selectors and declared loss profile."
    - "Replay package can resolve raw evidence by hash deterministically."
