  title: "Authority-surface monotonicity for optimization paths (sink-agnostic)"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Efficiency optimizations MUST preserve monotonic reduction of production agent
    authority surface and MUST NOT reintroduce direct external projection-sink
    actuation capability classes.

    This optimization interlock is bound to the implemented GitHub projection
    surface and associated capability families.

    For production FAC roles:
    - `AS(role, t+1) subseteq AS(role, t)`
    - `github_direct_surface(role, t) == 0`

    Any optimization without authoritative capability-surface diff evidence MUST deny.
  rationale: |
    Cost pressure can incentivize unsafe shortcuts. Authority-surface monotonicity
    prevents optimization from undoing containment guarantees established by security policy.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Every optimization proposal carries role-level capability-surface diff evidence."
    - "Gate denies any optimization that increases external authority surface for production FAC roles."
    - "Gate denies any optimization that restores github_api/gh_cli classes to production agent runtimes."
    - "Unknown or stale authority-surface evidence fails closed to deny."
