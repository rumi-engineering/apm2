  title: "Economics observability and security-interlocked optimization gates"
  category: "OPERABILITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Optimization decisions MUST be governed by economics telemetry (`C_verify`, `C_transfer`,
    `C_context`, `C_coord`, `C_replay`, `C_recovery`) and paired safety countermetrics.
    No optimization is admissible if it weakens security or replay-verifiability.

    Temporal objectives used by optimization gates MUST be represented as
    `TemporalSloProfileV1` tuples containing `baseline`, `target`, `window_ref`,
    `owner_locus`, `falsification_predicate`, `countermetrics`, and
    `boundary authority ref` (`TimeAuthorityEnvelopeV1`).
    Temporal objective predicates MUST bind to `TP-EIO29-*` IDs and be evaluated
    by `TemporalPredicateEvaluatorV1` (`evaluator_id=temporal_predicate_evaluator_v1`).
  rationale: |
    Efficiency metrics are Goodhart-prone unless constrained by independent safety signals.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Every optimization KPI has a required countermetric in gate policy."
    - "Optimization gate rejects proposals that reduce containment/verification posture."
    - "Budget breach forecasting is available pre-threshold for operators and orchestrators."
    - "Temporal predicates are evaluated by canonical TemporalPredicateEvaluatorV1, not prose-only SLO text."
    - "Unknown temporal contract fields fail closed."
