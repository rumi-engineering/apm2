  rfc_id: RFC-0011

  governance_overview: |
    RFC-0011 requires signoff from AUTH_PRODUCT, AUTH_SECURITY, and AUTH_ARCHITECTURE
    due to its scope across the kernel, compiler, policy, and security domains.
    Gate reviews follow the standard RFC council process.

  required_signoffs:
    - authority: AUTH_PRODUCT
      rationale: CAC fundamentally changes how context is authored and consumed
      signoff_scope: PRD requirements coverage, rollout strategy, success metrics

    - authority: AUTH_SECURITY
      rationale: CAC introduces new trust boundaries and security properties
      signoff_scope: Trust model, threat scenarios, emergency recovery procedures

    - authority: AUTH_ARCHITECTURE
      rationale: CAC is a cross-cutting architectural change
      signoff_scope: Component design, integration points, versioning strategy

  gate_configuration:
    review_depth: COUNCIL
    council_rationale: |
      RFC-0011 is a major architectural RFC (v0 Discovery) with 15 requirements,
      6 phases, and cross-crate changes. COUNCIL depth is mandatory per
      rfc-council-workflow.md SELECT_DEPTH rules.

        purpose: Verify design decisions address requirements
        applicability: v2+ (after design decisions)
        pass_criteria: |
          Each requirement has corresponding design decision.
          Acceptance criteria are testable.

      - gate_id: GATE-TCK-ANTI-COUSIN
        type: LLM_ASSISTED
        purpose: Verify no cousin abstractions introduced
        applicability: v4 (before ticket generation)
        pass_criteria: |
          Design extends existing patterns in codebase.
          No parallel abstractions for same concept.
          Component mapping grounded in CCP evidence.
