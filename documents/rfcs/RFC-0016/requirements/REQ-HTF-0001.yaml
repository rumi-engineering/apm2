  title: "Four-clock model"
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    HTF defines four clocks with explicit semantics and authority boundaries:
    - LedgerTime (L): authoritative ordering/truth within a ledger.
    - MonotonicTicks (M): authoritative durations/expiry on a node.
    - CausalTime (C/HLC): advisory causality/correlation across nodes.
    - BoundedWallTime (W): human-facing wall time as a bounded interval.

  rationale: |
    Collapsing time into a single timestamp creates replay non-determinism and
    enables time-manipulation attacks. Separate clocks prevent accidental misuse
    by making authority explicit and mechanically enforceable.

      verification: "Review RFC-0016/02_design_decisions.yaml definitions; ensure types exist in code."

      description: "Wall time is never authoritative for ordering or expiry."
      verification: "Static lint + targeted tests ensure no wall-authority in privileged paths."
