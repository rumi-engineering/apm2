  title: "Bounded wall time is interval-bounded and non-authoritative"
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    When wall time is recorded, it is represented as a bounded interval
    (t_min_utc_ns, t_max_utc_ns) with a declared source and confidence.

    The interval width must not exceed the bound declared in ClockProfile.
    Wall time is never used for authority decisions.

  rationale: |
    Human-facing timestamps are useful, but raw wall time is not safe as a
    protocol input. Representing wall time as a bounded interval makes
    uncertainty explicit and prevents accidental authority use.
