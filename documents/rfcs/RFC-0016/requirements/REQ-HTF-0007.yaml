  title: "ClockProfile governance"
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    Each node publishes a governed ClockProfileV1 referenced by hash in
    TimeEnvelopeV1. Policies can restrict acceptable profiles by risk tier.

    Phase 2+ may attach attestation evidence to ClockProfile and require it for
    high-risk operations.

  rationale: |
    Time envelopes are only meaningful when the clock assumptions are pinned.
    ClockProfile governance enables risk-tier controls and prevents silent drift
    in time source semantics.

      description: "ClockProfile is a governed CAC artifact and is pinned by hash in TimeEnvelope."
      verification: "Schema and admission checks enforce hash pinning."

      verification: "Schema supports optional attestation; PoC evidence optional."
