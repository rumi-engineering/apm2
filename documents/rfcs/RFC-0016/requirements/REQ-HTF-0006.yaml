  title: "No human-time units in normative artifacts by default"
  status: ACTIVE

  statement: |
    Normative artifacts (PRDs, RFCs, skills, laws, and policy documents) must
    not introduce human-time units by default.

    Human time is permitted only in explicit external-facing contexts.
    An escape hatch exists for externally-scoped statements, but it must be
    mechanically detectable and auditable.

  rationale: |
    Human time units in normative docs inevitably become authority inputs.
    They also drift under interpretation and undermine replayable reasoning.

    HTF forces internal semantics to be expressed in ledger windows and ticks.
