    "seed_content": "# RFC-0030 \u2014 Forge Refinement Pipeline: Mechanized Plan Admission from Intent to Pinned Plan-of-Record\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis document specifies the Forge Refinement Pipeline (FRP), a\nrepeatable, budgeted, adversarially-reviewed pipeline that converts an\nintent brief into two admitted planning documents \u2014 a Technical\nSpecification (TechSpec) and an Implementation Plan (ImplPlan) \u2014 and\npins their content-addressed digests as plan-of-record inputs for\nsubsequent work.\n\nFRP replaces template-driven document generation with patch-admitted\ndocument production. Agents do not complete forms. They draft sectioned\ncontent, propose explicit amendments as unified diffs, and provide\nreceipts that mechanical gates evaluate. Every transition in the\npipeline is ledger-anchored, CAS-backed, and deterministically\nreplayable. Admission requires receipt-bound closure under a quorum of\ndiverse reviewers; missing evidence is treated as failure.\n\nThe pipeline is a single WorkItem with explicit substages. It composes\nwith the Forge Admission Cycle (RFC-0019) evidence substrate, the\nHolonic Substrate Interface (RFC-0020) capability model, and the\nContext-as-Code pipeline (RFC-0011) for artifact serialization.\n\n\n## 1.  Requirements Notation\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n   o  \"fail-closed\" means that a missing, stale, ambiguous, or\n      unverifiable input causes denial, not degraded continuation.\n\n   o  \"content-addressed\" means identified by the cryptographic digest\n      (BLAKE3 unless otherwise specified) of the canonical byte\n      representation.\n\n   o  \"ledger-anchored\" means referenced by a KernelEvent appended to\n      the append-only ledger after the corresponding CAS artifact\n      exists (CAS-before-ledger invariant).\n\n\n## 2.  Definitions\n\n   DocPack:  A sectioned Markdown document directory with a machine-\n      readable manifest. A DocPack is the unit of admission for FRP.\n      Each DocPack contains one manifest, one or more section files,\n      and an assembly ordering. DocPacks are never \"filled in\" from\n      templates; they are produced by drafting, amended by explicit\n      diffs, and admitted by mechanical gates.\n\n   Section:  A single Markdown file within a DocPack. Every section\n      begins with a machine-readable header block that binds it to a\n      known base digest and document identity (Section 4.3). Sections\n      are the unit of parallel drafting, review, and diff application.\n\n   Amendment:  A proposed change to a DocPack expressed as a unified\n      diff plus structured findings. An amendment without a diff is\n      invalid (FRP-INV-007). Amendments are the sole mechanism by\n      which a DocPack transitions between revisions.\n\n   Intent Brief:  The single authoritative description of what is\n      being built and why. The Intent Brief MAY be produced by a\n      human, by an upstream pipeline, or by any autonomous process\n      that can satisfy the IntentBriefV1 schema. The origin is not\n      privileged; only schema conformance and immutability matter.\n      The Intent Brief is immutable once a refinement cycle begins;\n      modifications require a new cycle with a new intent_id.\n\n   Admitted:  A DocPack whose gate receipts, reviewer quorum receipts,\n      and diversity constraints all satisfy the admission policy. Only\n      admitted DocPacks may be pinned as plan-of-record.\n\n   Plan-of-Record Pin:  A ledger-anchored evidence artifact that\n      declares a pair of admitted DocPack digests (TechSpec +\n      ImplPlan) as the authoritative planning basis for subsequent\n      implementation work.\n\n   Verdict Semilattice:  The ordering FAIL > PENDING > PASS with\n      FAIL dominating. The join of any set containing FAIL is FAIL.\n      Missing evidence yields PENDING, which MUST NOT mask a co-\n      occurring FAIL.\n\n   Delta Report:  A deterministic comparison artifact produced after\n      each patch application. Contains before/after digests, gate\n      outcome changes, structural metric changes, and regression\n      detection results.\n\n\n## 3.  Invariants\n\nFRP does not introduce new governance semantics. It operates within\nthe vNext kernel constraint surface. The following invariants are\nnormative for all FRP implementations.\n\n   FRP-INV-001  Monotone truth substrate.\n      Authoritative facts are append-only and backed by content-\n      addressed evidence pointers (ledger + CAS). FRP MUST NOT\n      mutate admitted artifacts; it MUST produce new revisions.\n\n   FRP-INV-002  Authority attenuation and scarcity.\n      Capabilities are default-deny. Budgets (token, wall-time,\n      tool-call, iteration) and stop conditions are mandatory for\n      every agent invocation. Unbounded search or actuation is a\n      defect.\n\n   FRP-INV-003  Promotion is closure under receipts.\n      Nothing becomes authoritative (admitted, pinned) without\n      receipt-bound closure. The set of required receipts is defined\n      by the admission policy and MUST include gate receipts and\n      reviewer quorum receipts.\n\n   FRP-INV-004  Dominance ordering.\n      Containment/security > verification/correctness > liveness/\n      progress. When constraints conflict, FRP MUST deny, decompose,\n      or escalate. FRP MUST NOT \"push through\" a security or\n      correctness concern to preserve pipeline progress.\n\n   FRP-INV-005  Fail-closed verdict lattice.\n      FAIL > PENDING > PASS. Missing evidence yields PENDING.\n      PENDING MUST NOT mask a co-occurring FAIL. For plan-of-record\n      pinning, PENDING is treated as FAIL unless explicitly allowed\n      by a risk-tier-dependent policy waiver.\n\n   FRP-INV-006  Bounded views.\n      Agents operate on bounded ContextPacks with committed view\n      selectors. Direct messaging between agents is not a primitive;\n      coordination occurs through the stigmergic substrate\n      (ledger + CAS artifacts).\n\n   FRP-INV-007  Amendment validity.\n      An amendment without a unified diff is invalid and MUST be\n      rejected. Prose-only critique is not an admissible work\n      product. Every finding in an amendment MUST reference specific\n      patch hunks.\n\n   FRP-INV-008  Deterministic patch application.\n      Patch application MUST be deterministic and fail-closed. If a\n      patch does not apply cleanly against the declared base digest,\n      the PatchApplies gate MUST emit FAIL. No silent fuzzing,\n      offset tolerance, or approximate matching is permitted.\n\n   FRP-INV-009  Critic context isolation.\n      Critics MUST NOT receive prior iteration history \u2014 no previous\n      amendment bundles, delta reports, gate receipts, or iteration\n      counters. Each critic operates as if it is the first reviewer\n      of a fresh document. This prevents anchoring, effort diffusion,\n      and lazy agreement with prior reviewers.\n\n\n## 4.  Artifacts and Schemas\n\nFRP operates on the APM2 ledger + CAS substrate and emits evidence\nartifacts for every stage. All artifacts MUST be content-addressed,\nreferenced from ledger events, and attributable to an identity and\nrole specification.\n\n### 4.1.  Intent Brief\n\nThe Intent Brief is the input that initiates a refinement cycle. It\nis a CAC JSON artifact with schema `frp.intent_brief.v1`. The Intent\nBrief MAY originate from any source \u2014 human, upstream pipeline, or\nautonomous agent \u2014 provided it satisfies the schema. FRP is\nsource-agnostic; it validates structure, not provenance.\n\nFields:\n\n   intent_id:  Stable identifier (REQUIRED). Format:\n      `dcp://apm2.local/intents/<project_id>@v<N>`.\n\n   title:  Human-readable title (REQUIRED).\n\n   problem_statement:  Description of the problem to be solved\n      (REQUIRED).\n\n   goals:  Array of testable outcome statements (REQUIRED, non-empty).\n\n   non_goals:  Array of explicit exclusions (REQUIRED, MAY be empty).\n\n   constraints:  Array of security, correctness, compliance, or\n      ecosystem constraints (REQUIRED, non-empty).\n\n   risk_tier:  Risk classification (REQUIRED). Values: LOW, MEDIUM,\n      HIGH, CRITICAL.\n\n   acceptance_criteria:  Array of project-level acceptance predicates\n      (REQUIRED, non-empty). These are outcome criteria, not\n      implementation criteria.\n\n   references:  Array of repository paths, prior RFC IDs, or external\n      references (OPTIONAL).\n\nImmutability rule: Once an FRP cycle begins (WorkOpened event\nreferences intent_hash), the Intent Brief MUST NOT be modified.\nChanges to intent require a new intent_id and a new cycle. No\nhuman-in-the-loop is required or assumed at any point after the\nIntent Brief is provided.\n\n### 4.2.  Document Manifest\n\nEach document (TechSpec, ImplPlan) has a manifest with schema\n`frp.doc_manifest.v1`.\n\nFields:\n\n   doc_id:  Stable identifier (REQUIRED). Format:\n      `dcp://apm2.local/docs/<project_id>/<doc_kind>@v<N>`.\n\n   doc_kind:  One of: TECH_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN (REQUIRED).\n\n   classification:  Document classification (REQUIRED).\n\n   inputs:  Binding structure (REQUIRED):\n\n      intent_hash:  Content-addressed digest of the Intent Brief.\n\n      policy_root_hash:  Digest of the governing policy tree.\n\n      doctrine_refs:  Array of law/invariant/RFC identifiers that\n         this document must satisfy.\n\n   sections:  Array of section descriptors (REQUIRED, non-empty):\n\n      section_id:  Stable identifier (e.g., TS-0001). MUST be\n         unique within the manifest.\n\n      title:  Human-readable section title.\n\n      path:  Relative file path within the DocPack directory.\n\n      required_checks:  Array of gate identifiers that apply to\n         this section.\n\n   assembly:  Deterministic ordering specification (REQUIRED):\n\n      section_order:  Ordered array of section_id values defining\n         the canonical document order.\n\n   admission_policy:  Admission requirements (REQUIRED):\n\n      required_reviewer_roles:  Array of role identifiers.\n\n      quorum_rule:  Quorum specification (e.g., \"k-of-n with\n         diversity constraint d\").\n\n      required_gates:  Array of gate identifiers that MUST PASS\n         for admission.\n\n### 4.3.  Section Header\n\nEvery section file MUST begin with a machine-readable header as an\nHTML comment block. The header binds the section to a known base\nfor deterministic diff application.\n\nFormat:\n\n```\n<!--\nfrp.section.v1:\n  section_id: <section_id>\n  doc_id: <doc_id>\n  base_digest: <algorithm>:<hex>\n  last_admitted_at: <ledger_time_ref | null>\n-->\n```\n\n   section_id:  MUST match the section_id in the parent manifest.\n\n   doc_id:  MUST match the doc_id in the parent manifest.\n\n   base_digest:  Content-addressed digest of the section content\n      (excluding the header block itself) at the last admitted\n      revision. For initial drafts, this is the digest of the\n      empty string.\n\n   last_admitted_at:  Ledger time reference (HTF boundary ID) of\n      the last admission, or null for initial drafts.\n\nStale patch detection: A diff whose declared target base_digest\ndoes not match the current section content digest MUST be rejected\n(FRP-INV-008).\n\n### 4.4.  Amendment Bundle\n\nEvery critique MUST produce an amendment bundle with schema\n`frp.doc_amendment_bundle.v1`. An amendment without a changeset\n(unified diff) is invalid (FRP-INV-007).\n\nFields:\n\n   amendment_id:  Stable identifier (REQUIRED).\n\n   target_doc_id:  The doc_id of the DocPack being amended (REQUIRED).\n\n   target_base_digest:  Content-addressed digest of the full DocPack\n      at the base revision (REQUIRED).\n\n   changeset_bundle_hash:  Digest of a ChangesetBundleV1 artifact\n      stored in CAS containing the unified diff (REQUIRED).\n\n   review_artifact_hash:  Digest of a ReviewArtifactBundleV1 in\n      CAS containing the critique narrative and tool logs\n      (REQUIRED).\n\n   findings:  Array of finding structures (REQUIRED, non-empty):\n\n      finding_id:  Stable within this amendment.\n\n      severity:  One of: BLOCKER, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.\n\n      class:  Defect taxonomy key (OPTIONAL; from\n         documents/theory/unified-theory-v2.json when available).\n\n      evidence:  Structure containing section_id, start_line,\n         end_line identifying the problematic region.\n\n      expected_fix:  Array of patch hunk references within the\n         changeset_bundle that address this finding.\n\n   declared_intent:  One of: CORRECTNESS_FIX, SECURITY_HARDENING,\n      COMPLETENESS_EXPANSION, CONSISTENCY_REPAIR, CLARITY_REWRITE,\n      RISK_REDUCTION (REQUIRED).\n\n### 4.5.  Delta Report\n\nAfter each patch application, FRP MUST produce a delta report with\nschema `frp.doc_delta_report.v1`.\n\nFields:\n\n   before_digest:  DocPack digest before patch application.\n\n   after_digest:  DocPack digest after patch application.\n\n   structural_metrics:  Structure containing:\n\n      sections_present:  Count of non-empty sections.\n\n      sections_required:  Count from manifest.\n\n      placeholder_count:  Count of forbidden placeholder strings.\n\n      cross_ref_resolution_rate:  Fraction of section_id references\n         that resolve to existing sections.\n\n   gate_outcomes:  Array of (gate_id, verdict) pairs.\n\n   reviewer_receipt_set:  Array of receipt digests.\n\n   regressions:  Array of (metric_name, before_value, after_value)\n      for any metric that worsened.\n\n\n### 4.6.  DocPack Directory Structure\n\nA DocPack is a directory with the following layout:\n\n```\ndocuments/forge/<project_id>/\n  intent.intent_brief.v1.cac.json\n  tech_spec/\n    manifest.doc_manifest.v1.cac.json\n    sections/\n      TS-0001_problem_and_goals.md\n      TS-0002_non_goals.md\n      TS-0003_system_context.md\n      TS-0004_architecture.md\n      TS-0005_data_model.md\n      TS-0006_interfaces.md\n      TS-0007_security_model.md\n      TS-0008_correctness_model.md\n      TS-0009_operational_model.md\n      TS-0010_governance.md\n      TS-0011_migration.md\n      TS-0012_open_questions.md\n      TS-0013_appendices.md\n  impl_plan/\n    manifest.doc_manifest.v1.cac.json\n    sections/\n      IP-0001_milestones.md\n      IP-0002_work_breakdown.md\n      IP-0003_dependency_graph.md\n      IP-0004_risk_register.md\n      IP-0005_verification_plan.md\n      IP-0006_resource_budgets.md\n      IP-0007_backout_procedures.md\n      IP-0008_acceptance_mapping.md\n```\n\n\n## 5.  Pipeline State Machine\n\nFRP is implemented as a single parent WorkItem with schema\n`frp.refinement_work.v1`. The work item progresses through nine\nordered substages. Each substage transition MUST be driven by\nledger-visible events and MUST produce evidence artifacts.\n\n### 5.1.  Substage Definitions\n\n#### 5.1.1.  INTAKE\n\n   Precondition:  A valid IntentBriefV1 exists at the specified path.\n\n   Actions:\n      1. Validate Intent Brief against schema.\n      2. Store Intent Brief in CAS; obtain intent_hash.\n      3. Open refinement WorkItem referencing intent_hash.\n\n   Evidence emitted:\n      o  WorkOpened(work_id, intent_hash)\n      o  EvidencePublished(intent_brief, intent_hash)\n\n   Failure mode:  Schema validation failure -> WorkItem not opened.\n\n#### 5.1.2.  FRAME\n\n   Precondition:  INTAKE complete.\n\n   Actions:\n      1. Resolve governing policy (laws, invariants, RFCs).\n      2. Generate DocManifests for TechSpec and ImplPlan.\n      3. Generate section skeleton files with headers (base_digest\n         of empty content).\n      4. Store manifests and skeletons in CAS.\n\n   Evidence emitted:\n      o  EvidencePublished(doc_manifest, tech_spec_manifest_hash)\n      o  EvidencePublished(doc_manifest, impl_plan_manifest_hash)\n\n   Failure mode:  Policy resolution failure -> FAIL with\n      PolicyResolutionBlocked event.\n\n#### 5.1.3.  DRAFT\n\n   Precondition:  FRAME complete.\n\n   Actions:\n      1. For each section in each DocPack, invoke a Drafter agent\n         with bounded context (ContextPack containing intent,\n         manifest, doctrine refs, and relevant prior artifacts).\n      2. Drafter produces section content.\n      3. Store each drafted section snapshot in CAS.\n\n   Evidence emitted:\n      o  For each section: EvidencePublished(draft_section_snapshot,\n         section_hash)\n\n   Failure mode:  Budget exhaustion -> FAIL with\n      BudgetExhausted event.\n\n#### 5.1.4.  CRITIQUE\n\n   Precondition:  DRAFT complete (working draft exists).\n\n   Context isolation rule:  Each critic MUST receive the current\n      working DocPack as if it were the initial draft. The critic's\n      ContextPack MUST NOT contain: previous iteration amendment\n      bundles, prior delta reports, prior gate receipts, or any\n      indicator of which iteration this is. The critic must believe\n      it is the first and only reviewer. This prevents anchoring to\n      prior reviews, lazy \"agree with predecessor\" behavior, and\n      effort reduction from perceived review-chain diffusion.\n      The intent brief, manifest, and doctrine refs ARE included.\n\n   Actions:\n      1. Invoke critic agents with adversarial framing\n         (Section 6.2) and context isolation (above).\n      2. Each critic MUST produce a DocAmendmentBundleV1 with\n         unified diff and structured findings.\n      3. Store amendment bundles in CAS.\n\n   Verifier diversity requirement:  At least K=2 independent\n      reviewer families MUST produce amendment bundles. Diversity\n      is achieved through model selection (Section 6.3), not\n      through prompt or configuration variation of the same model.\n\n   Evidence emitted:\n      o  For each critique:\n         - EvidencePublished(review_artifact_bundle, review_hash)\n         - EvidencePublished(changeset_bundle, changeset_hash)\n         - EvidencePublished(doc_amendment_bundle, amendment_hash)\n\n   Failure mode:  Critic produces amendment without diff ->\n      amendment rejected (FRP-INV-007). Budget exhaustion ->\n      FAIL.\n\n#### 5.1.5.  APPLY\n\n   Precondition:  CRITIQUE complete (amendment bundles exist).\n\n   Single-amendment rule:  Although multiple critics produce\n      amendment bundles independently (a prompting technique for\n      diverse coverage), only ONE amendment bundle is selected for\n      application per iteration. Merging parallel diffs is\n      explicitly prohibited \u2014 it introduces conflict resolution\n      complexity for no structural benefit.\n\n   Actions:\n      1. Score amendment bundles by: (a) count of BLOCKER findings\n         addressed, then (b) count of HIGH findings addressed,\n         then (c) total finding count. Select the highest-scoring\n         bundle. Ties are broken by earliest submission timestamp.\n      2. Apply the selected changeset using a deterministic patch\n         engine.\n      3. Produce a Delta Report.\n      4. Non-selected amendment bundles are retained in CAS as\n         evidence but are not applied. Findings from non-selected\n         bundles that survive into the next iteration's working\n         DocPack will be independently rediscovered by fresh\n         critics (Section 5.1.4, context isolation rule).\n\n   Determinism requirement:  Patch application MUST use a\n      deterministic engine (e.g., `git apply --check` followed by\n      `git apply`). If the selected patch does not apply cleanly,\n      APPLY emits FAIL for this iteration and the next CRITIQUE\n      cycle operates on the unchanged DocPack. Model-based\n      rewriting and conflict resolution subtasks are not permitted.\n\n   Evidence emitted:\n      o  EvidencePublished(delta_report, delta_hash)\n      o  Updated DocPack snapshot:\n         - EvidencePublished(docpack_snapshot, snapshot_hash)\n\n   Failure mode:  Patch does not apply cleanly -> PatchApplies\n      gate emits FAIL -> DocPack unchanged, next iteration begins.\n\n#### 5.1.6.  VERIFY\n\n   Precondition:  APPLY complete (updated DocPack exists).\n\n   Actions:\n      1. Run Tier 0 gates (structural).\n      2. Run Tier 1 gates (mechanical-semantic).\n      3. Run Tier 2 gates (LLM-assisted audits, receipted).\n      4. Evaluate plateau detection (Section 8.3).\n\n   Gate evaluation is described in Section 7.\n\n   Evidence emitted:\n      o  For each gate:\n         - GateReceiptGenerated(gate_id, verdict, evidence_ids[])\n\n   Failure mode:  Any Tier 0 or Tier 1 gate FAIL -> loop back to\n      CRITIQUE with failure context. Plateau detected -> halt\n      with PipelineStalled event.\n\n#### 5.1.7.  ADMIT\n\n   Precondition:  VERIFY complete with all required gates PASS\n      (or explicitly waived per policy).\n\n   Actions:\n      1. Evaluate admission closure: verify all required gate\n         receipts exist and are PASS.\n      2. Verify reviewer quorum: required number of reviewers from\n         required number of distinct families have produced PASS\n         receipts for each gate category.\n      3. Store admitted DocPack snapshot in CAS.\n\n   Evidence emitted:\n      o  EvidencePublished(admitted_docpack_snapshot,\n         admitted_digest)\n\n   Failure mode:  Quorum not met -> FAIL. Gate receipt missing ->\n      FAIL (FRP-INV-005). Any FAIL in required gate set -> FAIL.\n\n#### 5.1.8.  PIN\n\n   Precondition:  ADMIT complete for both TechSpec and ImplPlan.\n\n   Actions:\n      1. Construct plan-of-record pin artifact binding:\n         - admitted TechSpec digest\n         - admitted ImplPlan digest\n         - intent_hash\n         - admission receipt set\n      2. Store pin artifact in CAS.\n      3. Anchor pin to ledger.\n\n   Evidence emitted:\n      o  EvidencePublished(plan_of_record_pin, pin_hash)\n\n   Failure mode:  Missing admission for either document -> FAIL.\n\n#### 5.1.9.  HANDOFF\n\n   Precondition:  PIN complete.\n\n   Actions:\n      1. Construct handoff manifest containing:\n         - pin_hash\n         - techspec_doc_id + digest\n         - implplan_doc_id + digest\n         - ticket decomposition pointers (if generated)\n         - suggested implementer context pack selectors\n      2. Store handoff manifest in CAS.\n      3. Anchor to ledger.\n\n   Evidence emitted:\n      o  EvidencePublished(handoff_manifest, handoff_hash)\n\n   Terminal state. The refinement WorkItem is closed.\n\n### 5.2.  Iteration Loop\n\nSubstages CRITIQUE, APPLY, and VERIFY form an iteration loop. The\npipeline MUST repeat this loop until one of the following conditions\nholds:\n\n   a) All required gates PASS and quorum is satisfied (proceed to\n      ADMIT).\n\n   b) Maximum iteration count reached (halt with\n      IterationLimitReached event).\n\n   c) Budget exhausted (halt with BudgetExhausted event).\n\n   d) Plateau detected for N consecutive iterations (halt with\n      PipelineStalled event).\n\n   e) Safety gate FAIL persists after M retries (halt with\n      SafetyHalt event; pipeline cannot self-resolve).\n\nThe iteration counter, budget consumption, and plateau state MUST\nbe recorded in each Delta Report.\n\n### 5.3.  Ledger Event Summary\n\nThe following ledger events MUST be emitted at minimum. Each event\nreferences one or more CAS artifact digests.\n\n```\nWorkOpened(work_id, intent_hash)\nEvidencePublished(kind, artifact_hash)         -- per artifact\nGateReceiptGenerated(gate_id, verdict, [evidence_hash])\nPipelineStalled(work_id, iteration, reason)    -- on halt\nBudgetExhausted(work_id, dimension, consumed, limit)\nSafetyHalt(work_id, gate_id, iteration)\nWorkClosed(work_id, outcome, pin_hash | failure_report_hash)\n```\n\n### 5.4.  Fail-Closed Semantics\n\nFRP uses the verdict semilattice FAIL > PENDING > PASS.\n\n   o  The join of any set of verdicts containing FAIL is FAIL.\n\n   o  Missing evidence yields PENDING.\n\n   o  PENDING MUST NOT mask a co-occurring FAIL.\n\n   o  For plan-of-record pinning, PENDING is treated as FAIL\n      unless explicitly allowed by a risk-tier-dependent policy\n      waiver recorded as a ledger event.\n\n\n## 6.  Role System\n\nFRP employs a multi-agent adversarial protocol. Agents are assigned\nroles via RoleSpecV1 artifacts (RFC-0019 REQ-0012). Each role\ncarries a capability manifest that defines tool access.\n\n### 6.1.  Required Roles\n\nEvery FRP execution MUST include agents in the following roles:\n\n   Drafter:  Produces section content for a DocPack. Read access to\n      intent, manifest, doctrine refs, and relevant prior artifacts.\n      Write access limited to a sandbox output directory.\n\n   Red-Team Critic:  Identifies flaws and proposes corrections as\n      amendment bundles. Instructed with adversarial framing\n      (Section 6.3). Read access to the working DocPack and\n      doctrine refs. Write access limited to amendment output.\n\n   Consistency Auditor:  Evaluates cross-section and cross-document\n      consistency. Produces amendment bundles for contradictions,\n      broken references, and semantic drift between TechSpec and\n      ImplPlan.\n\n   Security Auditor:  Evaluates threat coverage, boundary\n      constraints, least-privilege adherence, and attack surface.\n      Produces amendment bundles for security deficiencies.\n\n   Patch Applier:  Applies amendment diffs to the working DocPack\n      using a deterministic patch engine. This role SHOULD be\n      implemented as a deterministic tool, not a model. If model\n      involvement is required (conflict resolution), it MUST\n      produce a new amendment bundle subject to standard gates.\n\n   Gate Runner:  Executes mechanical gate checks (Section 7).\n      Read-only access to the DocPack and gate definitions.\n      Produces gate receipts.\n\n### 6.2.  Adversarial Critique Protocol\n\nEvery critic (Red-Team, Consistency Auditor, Security Auditor) MUST\nreceive the following system-level instruction framing:\n\n   \"Assume this document was produced by a less capable agent under\n   time pressure. It contains contradictions, missing constraints,\n   weak threat coverage, underspecified interfaces, and implicit\n   assumptions. Your task is to find every deficiency and propose\n   an explicit fix as a unified diff. Do not praise, hedge, or\n   agree. State what is wrong and fix it.\"\n\nThis framing is a normative requirement, not a suggestion. Critique\nsessions that do not apply adversarial framing MUST be treated as\nnon-compliant and their outputs rejected.\n\n#### 6.2.1.  Critique Output Format\n\nCritic output MUST be a single structured document in two mandatory\nsections, emitted in order: FINDINGS followed by PATCH. The output\nMUST be parseable by a deterministic extractor into a\nDocAmendmentBundleV1 (Section 4.4) without model assistance.\n\nThe output format is:\n\n```\n---BEGIN FINDINGS---\n- id: F-001\n  severity: BLOCKER | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW\n  class: <defect_taxonomy_key | UNCLASSIFIED>\n  section: <section_id>\n  lines: <start_line>-<end_line>\n  description: |\n    <concise description of the deficiency>\n  fix_hunks: [1]\n\n- id: F-002\n  severity: HIGH\n  class: MISSING_CONSTRAINT\n  section: TS-0007\n  lines: 42-58\n  description: |\n    <concise description of the deficiency>\n  fix_hunks: [2, 3]\n\n...\n---END FINDINGS---\n\n---BEGIN PATCH---\n<unified diff against the declared base_digest, with standard\n unified diff headers per section file>\n---END PATCH---\n```\n\nField definitions for each finding:\n\n   id:  Finding identifier, unique within this critique. Format:\n      F-NNN, monotonically increasing.\n\n   severity:  One of BLOCKER, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW. Severity\n      determines application priority (Section 5.1.5).\n\n   class:  Defect taxonomy key from documents/theory/unified-theory-v2.json\n      when a match exists. UNCLASSIFIED otherwise. Parsers MUST\n      accept both known keys and UNCLASSIFIED.\n\n   section:  The section_id (from the DocManifest) where the\n      deficiency occurs.\n\n   lines:  Line range within the section file (excluding the\n      header block). Format: <start>-<end>, inclusive, 1-indexed.\n      For findings that span the entire section, use 1-<last_line>.\n\n   description:  Plain text description of the deficiency. MUST\n      state what is wrong, not what is right. MUST NOT contain\n      praise, hedging, or qualifications. Maximum 500 tokens.\n\n   fix_hunks:  Array of 1-indexed hunk numbers within the PATCH\n      section that address this finding. Every hunk in the PATCH\n      MUST be referenced by at least one finding. Every finding\n      MUST reference at least one hunk.\n\nPatch section requirements:\n\n   o  The patch MUST be a valid unified diff (output of\n      `diff -u` or equivalent).\n\n   o  Diff headers MUST use the section file's relative path\n      within the DocPack (e.g., `sections/TS-0007_security_model.md`).\n\n   o  Hunks are numbered sequentially starting at 1, in the order\n      they appear in the diff output. This numbering is implicit\n      (determined by position) and is used by fix_hunks references.\n\n   o  The patch MUST apply cleanly against the section content at\n      the base_digest declared in the section header. A patch that\n      references stale content is invalid (FRP-INV-008).\n\nValidation rules for the extraction pipeline:\n\n   o  Output that omits either the FINDINGS or PATCH section MUST\n      be rejected.\n\n   o  Output where any finding has zero fix_hunks MUST be rejected\n      (FRP-INV-007: findings without diffs are invalid).\n\n   o  Output where any hunk is unreferenced by any finding MUST be\n      rejected (orphan hunks indicate untraced changes).\n\n   o  Output where severity is not one of the four enumerated values\n      MUST be rejected.\n\n   o  Output where section does not match a section_id in the\n      DocManifest MUST be rejected.\n\n   o  Findings with description exceeding 500 tokens MUST be\n      truncated with a parser warning, not rejected.\n\n### 6.3.  Verifier Diversity\n\nTo reduce correlated failure modes (e.g., shared model blind spots),\nFRP MUST enforce verifier diversity:\n\n   o  At least K=2 independent reviewer families MUST produce PASS\n      receipts for each required gate category.\n\n   o  \"Independent reviewer family\" means distinct frontier-tier\n      models from different providers (e.g., different model families\n      with independent training runs). Prompt variation, temperature\n      variation, or tool-configuration variation of the same model\n      does NOT constitute a distinct family \u2014 these share the same\n      blind spots.\n\n   o  Model selection for each reviewer slot MUST include a random\n      component drawn from a curated frontier-model roster. The\n      roster is maintained as a policy artifact and MUST contain\n      only models assessed as frontier-capable for the critique\n      task. This prevents ossification around a single model and\n      ensures genuine diversity.\n\n   o  The diversity constraint is parameterized in the admission\n      policy and MAY be increased for higher risk tiers.\n\n\n## 7.  Gate Specification\n\nGates are mechanical checks that evaluate DocPack quality. Gates\nare organized into three tiers by automation level.\n\n### 7.1.  Tier 0: Structural Gates\n\nTier 0 gates are fully deterministic and require no model\ninvolvement.\n\n   GATE-T0-SECTIONS:  All sections declared in the manifest exist\n      as files with non-empty content (excluding header).\n\n   GATE-T0-HEADERS:  Every section file begins with a valid\n      frp.section.v1 header block. Header section_id and doc_id\n      match the parent manifest.\n\n   GATE-T0-PLACEHOLDERS:  No section contains forbidden placeholder\n      strings. The forbidden set is: \"TBD\", \"TODO\", \"FIXME\",\n      \"PLACEHOLDER\", \"LOREM\", \"[INSERT\", \"XXX\". Matching is\n      case-insensitive.\n\n   GATE-T0-CROSSREFS:  All section_id references within document\n      content resolve to sections declared in the manifest.\n\n### 7.2.  Tier 1: Mechanical-Semantic Gates\n\nTier 1 gates are deterministic but require parsing structured\ncontent within sections.\n\n   GATE-T1-SCHEMA-VALID:  All embedded schema blocks (JSON Schema,\n      Protobuf, TypeScript interface definitions) parse and\n      validate.\n\n   GATE-T1-TRACEABILITY:  Every ImplPlan milestone references at\n      least one TechSpec section_id. Every TechSpec gate or\n      invariant declaration has a corresponding verification point\n      in the ImplPlan.\n\n   GATE-T1-INTENT-COVERAGE:  Every goal in the Intent Brief is\n      referenced by at least one TechSpec section and at least one\n      ImplPlan milestone.\n\n   GATE-T1-CONSTRAINT-COVERAGE:  Every constraint in the Intent\n      Brief is addressed in the TechSpec security model or\n      correctness model section.\n\n### 7.3.  Tier 2: Receipted Audit Gates\n\nTier 2 gates are LLM-assisted but MUST produce structured,\nreceipted output. Tier 2 gate results are evidence categories\nwhose absence yields PENDING (not PASS).\n\n   GATE-T2-CONSISTENCY:  An auditor identifies contradictions\n      across sections within a document and across documents.\n      Output: structured findings with section references.\n\n   GATE-T2-THREAT-MODEL:  An auditor enumerates attack surfaces\n      and evaluates whether mitigations are specified for each.\n      Output: threat/mitigation coverage matrix.\n\n   GATE-T2-INVARIANT-VERIFICATION:  An auditor lists all stated\n      invariants and evaluates whether each has a verification\n      procedure in the ImplPlan. Output: invariant coverage matrix.\n\nFor all Tier 2 gates:\n\n   o  The auditor MUST produce a ReviewArtifactBundleV1 stored in\n      CAS.\n\n   o  The gate receipt MUST reference the review artifact hash.\n\n   o  Tier 2 gate FAIL does not automatically block admission for\n      LOW risk-tier projects, but MUST be recorded and visible.\n\n   o  Tier 2 gate FAIL MUST block admission for HIGH and CRITICAL\n      risk-tier projects.\n\n\n## 8.  Budgeting and Stop Conditions\n\nUnbounded refinement is a failure mode. FRP MUST enforce budgets\nand stop conditions for every agent invocation and for the pipeline\nas a whole.\n\n### 8.1.  Budget Dimensions\n\nThe following budgets MUST be enforced:\n\n   Per-agent budgets:\n\n      token_budget:  Maximum input + output tokens per invocation.\n\n      wall_time_budget:  Maximum wall-clock duration per invocation.\n\n      tool_call_budget:  Maximum tool invocations per agent session.\n\n   Per-cycle budgets:\n\n      max_iterations:  Maximum CRITIQUE-APPLY-VERIFY loops.\n\n      max_concurrent_reviewers:  Maximum simultaneous critic agents.\n\n      total_token_budget:  Maximum tokens across all agent\n         invocations in the cycle.\n\n      total_wall_time_budget:  Maximum wall-clock duration for the\n         entire cycle.\n\n### 8.2.  Stop Conditions\n\nThe pipeline MUST halt when any of the following is true:\n\n   a) max_iterations reached.\n\n   b) Any per-cycle budget exhausted.\n\n   c) Plateau detected for N consecutive iterations (Section 8.3).\n\n   d) Safety gate FAIL persists after M retries (terminal halt).\n\n   e) Agent invocation exceeds its per-agent budget (that agent's\n      output is discarded; cycle may continue with remaining budget).\n\n### 8.3.  Plateau Detection\n\nA patch set is considered \"improving\" if and only if at least one\nof the following holds:\n\n   a) The count of FAILing gates decreases.\n\n   b) At least one BLOCKER or HIGH finding is resolved (finding\n      present in previous iteration, absent in current).\n\n   c) Structural completeness increases (sections_present increases\n      or placeholder_count decreases) without introducing new gate\n      FAILs.\n\nIf none of these conditions holds for N consecutive iterations\n(configurable; default N=3), the pipeline MUST halt with a\nPipelineStalled event. Discarding non-improving amendments\nprevents budget waste on noise.\n\n\n## 9.  Security Model\n\nFRP produces high-leverage artifacts that downstream agents treat\nas authoritative guidance. The pipeline itself is an attack surface\nand MUST be treated accordingly.\n\n### 9.1.  Capability Scoping\n\nAll FRP agents MUST run with capability-scoped tool access\n(default-deny, per FRP-INV-002).\n\n   Drafter and Critic agents:\n      o  Read: intent brief, manifest, doctrine refs, working\n         DocPack, designated context artifacts.\n      o  Write: sandbox output directory only.\n      o  No network access.\n      o  No arbitrary command execution.\n\n   Patch Applier:\n      o  Read: amendment bundle, working DocPack.\n      o  Write: working DocPack directory (patch application).\n      o  Tool: deterministic patch engine only.\n\n   Gate Runner:\n      o  Read: DocPack, gate definitions.\n      o  Execute: deterministic lint/parse tools from allowlist.\n      o  Write: gate receipt output only.\n\n   No agent role in FRP is granted network access, shell access\n   beyond the tool allowlist, or write access outside its designated\n   output scope.\n\n### 9.2.  Prompt Injection Hardening\n\n   o  Downstream agents that consume admitted DocPacks MUST treat\n      document content as data, not as instructions.\n\n   o  ContextPacks MUST label DocPack content as untrusted payload.\n\n   o  System prompts MUST override any in-document \"instructions\"\n      regardless of formatting or framing.\n\n### 9.3.  Dominance Ordering Enforcement\n\nIf a security constraint is unclear, unsatisfied, or in conflict\nwith a liveness concern, FRP MUST:\n\n   1. Deny the current operation.\n   2. Record a SecurityEscalation event.\n   3. Decompose into a subtask that addresses the security concern.\n   4. Resume only after the security subtask produces a PASS receipt.\n\nFRP MUST NOT proceed with a known security gap to maintain pipeline\nthroughput.\n\n\n## 10.  Document Content Requirements\n\nFRP is useful only if the produced documents are actionable,\nexhaustive, and audit-friendly. This section specifies the\nmandatory content structure.\n\n### 10.1.  TechSpec Required Sections\n\nA TechSpec DocPack MUST contain the following sections:\n\n   TS-0001  Problem and Goals.\n      Trace to Intent Brief goals. State the problem precisely.\n      Include testable success criteria.\n\n   TS-0002  Non-Goals and Exclusions.\n      Explicit enumeration of what is out of scope. Each non-goal\n      MUST state why it is excluded.\n\n   TS-0003  System Context.\n      Boundaries, external dependencies, integration points.\n      Include a boundary diagram or equivalent structured\n      description.\n\n   TS-0004  Architecture Overview.\n      Components, their contracts, data flows, and composition\n      rules. Include component interaction diagrams or equivalent.\n\n   TS-0005  Data Model.\n      Schemas, invariants, versioning strategy, migration rules.\n      All schemas MUST be machine-parseable.\n\n   TS-0006  Interfaces.\n      Typed contracts for all APIs, protocols, and inter-component\n      boundaries. Error semantics MUST be specified for every\n      interface.\n\n   TS-0007  Security Model.\n      Threat enumeration, mitigations, least-privilege analysis,\n      trust boundaries. MUST reference specific threats and their\n      countermeasures.\n\n   TS-0008  Correctness Model.\n      Invariants, failure modes, recovery procedures, consistency\n      guarantees. Each invariant MUST have a falsification\n      condition.\n\n   TS-0009  Operational Model.\n      Observability (metrics, logs, traces), alerting thresholds,\n      capacity planning assumptions.\n\n   TS-0010  Governance and Gating.\n      What becomes authoritative and through what closure procedure.\n      Gate definitions for the system being specified.\n\n   TS-0011  Migration and Rollout.\n      Phases, reversibility criteria, rollback procedures, feature\n      flag strategy.\n\n   TS-0012  Open Questions.\n      Explicit, enumerated. Each question MUST state the decision\n      deadline and the default resolution if no decision is made.\n\n   TS-0013  Appendices.\n      Glossary, references, test vectors, supplementary diagrams.\n\n### 10.2.  ImplPlan Required Sections\n\nAn ImplPlan DocPack MUST contain the following sections:\n\n   IP-0001  Milestones.\n      Ordered sequence with exit criteria per milestone. Each\n      milestone MUST reference one or more TechSpec section_ids.\n\n   IP-0002  Work Breakdown.\n      Ticket or epic decomposition. Each unit MUST be independently\n      verifiable.\n\n   IP-0003  Dependency Graph.\n      Explicit ordering constraints between work units. Critical\n      path identification.\n\n   IP-0004  Risk Register.\n      Risks including security and correctness risks. Each risk\n      MUST state likelihood, impact, and mitigation.\n\n   IP-0005  Verification Plan.\n      Tests, gates, audits mapped to TechSpec invariants and\n      acceptance criteria. Every TechSpec invariant MUST have a\n      verification point.\n\n   IP-0006  Resource Budgets.\n      Time, compute, and review bandwidth estimates per milestone.\n\n   IP-0007  Backout Procedures.\n      Rollback procedures per milestone. Criteria for triggering\n      rollback.\n\n   IP-0008  Acceptance Mapping.\n      Mapping from Intent Brief acceptance_criteria to specific\n      deliverables and verification points. Every acceptance\n      criterion MUST trace to at least one milestone and one\n      verification point.\n\n### 10.3.  Traceability Requirements\n\n   o  Every ImplPlan milestone MUST reference at least one TechSpec\n      section_id (GATE-T1-TRACEABILITY).\n\n   o  Every TechSpec invariant or gate declaration MUST have a\n      corresponding verification point in the ImplPlan\n      (GATE-T1-TRACEABILITY).\n\n   o  Every Intent Brief goal MUST be referenced by at least one\n      TechSpec section and one ImplPlan milestone\n      (GATE-T1-INTENT-COVERAGE).\n\n   o  Every Intent Brief constraint MUST be addressed in the\n      TechSpec security or correctness model\n      (GATE-T1-CONSTRAINT-COVERAGE).\n\nFailure of any traceability requirement is a Tier 1 gate FAIL.\n\n\n## 11.  Observability and Replay\n\n### 11.1.  Artifact Publication\n\nFor every FRP execution, the following artifacts MUST be published\nto CAS and referenced from ledger events:\n\n   o  Intent Brief\n   o  DocManifests (one per document)\n   o  Every drafted section snapshot (per iteration)\n   o  Every amendment bundle\n   o  Every patch application result (Delta Report)\n   o  Every gate receipt\n   o  Admitted DocPack snapshots (on admission)\n   o  Plan-of-record pin (on pinning)\n   o  Handoff manifest (on handoff)\n   o  Failure report (on pipeline failure)\n\n### 11.2.  Replay Contract\n\nA third party with access to:\n\n   o  the ledger event stream for the refinement WorkItem, and\n   o  the CAS blobs referenced by those ledger events\n\nMUST be able to reconstruct:\n\n   o  the exact drafts produced at each iteration,\n   o  the exact diffs proposed by each critic,\n   o  the exact gate results at each iteration,\n   o  the final admitted state (or the failure state and reason).\n\nThis is the \"substrate as world\" requirement: the ledger + CAS\nconstitute a complete, deterministically replayable record of the\nrefinement process.\n\n### 11.3.  Per-Iteration Metrics\n\nEach Delta Report MUST include the following metrics:\n\n   o  Completeness score: sections_present / sections_required.\n   o  Placeholder count.\n   o  Gate pass/fail counts by tier.\n   o  Finding counts by severity.\n   o  Patch size: lines added, lines removed.\n   o  Reviewer diversity: number of distinct families that produced\n      receipts.\n   o  Cost: token consumption, wall-clock time.\n\n\n## 12.  CLI Interface\n\nFRP MUST be operable as CLI commands that produce an auditable\nworkspace directory plus ledger evidence.\n\n### 12.1.  Init\n\n```\napm2 forge refine init --project <id> --intent <path_to_intent.cac.json>\n```\n\n   o  Validates Intent Brief against schema.\n   o  Generates DocManifests and section skeletons.\n   o  Publishes intent + manifests as evidence.\n   o  Creates DocPack directory structure.\n\n### 12.2.  Run\n\n```\napm2 forge refine run --project <id> \\\n    --max-iters <N> \\\n    --policy <policy_ref> \\\n    [--token-budget <T>] \\\n    [--wall-time-budget <seconds>]\n```\n\n   o  Executes DRAFT -> CRITIQUE -> APPLY -> VERIFY loop.\n   o  Publishes all artifacts per iteration.\n   o  Halts fail-closed on budget exhaustion, plateau, or\n      persistent safety FAIL.\n   o  Exits with non-zero status on any terminal failure.\n\n### 12.3.  Admit and Pin\n\n```\napm2 forge refine admit --project <id>\n```\n\n   o  Evaluates admission closure (quorum + gates).\n   o  On PASS: emits plan-of-record pin evidence, generates\n      handoff manifest.\n   o  On FAIL: emits failure report evidence with specific\n      gate/quorum deficiencies.\n\n### 12.4.  Replay\n\n```\napm2 forge refine replay --project <id> \\\n    --ledger <ledger.jsonl> \\\n    --cas <cas_path>\n```\n\n   o  Reconstructs the full refinement history from ledger + CAS.\n   o  Verifies all artifact digests.\n   o  Verifies all gate receipts.\n   o  Reports any discrepancies.\n\n\n## 13.  YAML Template Migration\n\nFRP replaces template-driven document generation. Migration is\nincremental.\n\n### 13.1.  Migration Steps\n\n   1. Existing RFC/PRD skeleton generation tools output DocPack\n      skeletons (sectioned Markdown with manifest), not YAML\n      forms.\n\n   2. A parser/linter for DocPack manifests and section headers\n      is implemented as a Tier 0 gate.\n\n   3. Amendment diffs become the primary work product of critics.\n      Critics no longer \"fill in\" template fields.\n\n   4. YAML projections MAY be generated from admitted DocPacks\n      for legacy tooling compatibility. YAML projections are\n      derived artifacts, not authoritative.\n\n### 13.2.  Why This Addresses Rubber-Stamping\n\n   o  Agents are not rewarded for completing fields. They are\n      evaluated on the quality of content and the specificity of\n      amendments.\n\n   o  Gates enforce completeness mechanically. Structural gates\n      catch missing sections and placeholders; Tier 2 audits\n      evaluate substantive coverage.\n\n   o  Critics are structurally incentivized to find defects\n      (adversarial framing + quorum requirement + diversity\n      constraint).\n\n   o  Every transition is auditable. \"Rubber stamping\" produces\n      a visible, replayable evidence trail of low-quality\n      amendments and perfunctory gate passes.\n\n\n## 14.  Acceptance Criteria\n\nFRP v1 is acceptable when all of the following hold:\n\n   AC-01:  Given an IntentBriefV1, the pipeline produces both an\n      admitted TechSpec DocPack and an admitted ImplPlan DocPack.\n\n   AC-02:  Both admitted DocPacks have deterministic content-\n      addressed digests, published gate receipts for all required\n      gates, and reviewer quorum receipts satisfying diversity\n      constraints.\n\n   AC-03:  A replay runner reconstructs the admitted outputs from\n      ledger + CAS alone, with no external state.\n\n   AC-04:  The pipeline halts fail-closed on: missing/stale\n      evidence, patch application conflicts, gate FAILs that\n      exceed retry limits, and budget exhaustion.\n\n   AC-05:  The pipeline is fully autonomous. No human intervention\n      is required between providing the Intent Brief and consuming\n      the admitted outputs. The pipeline halts on unresolvable\n      failures rather than escalating to a human.\n\n   AC-06:  Traceability gates (GATE-T1-TRACEABILITY,\n      GATE-T1-INTENT-COVERAGE, GATE-T1-CONSTRAINT-COVERAGE) pass\n      for both admitted documents.\n\n   AC-07:  No agent in the pipeline has capabilities beyond its\n      designated role allowlist.\n\n   AC-08:  The pipeline demonstrates measurable improvement across\n      iterations (at least one CRITIQUE-APPLY-VERIFY cycle reduces\n      gate failures or resolves BLOCKER/HIGH findings).\n\n\n## 15.
