  title: "Declassification receipt consumption as PCAC-gated effects"
  category: "CODE_AND_TEST"
  status: "STUB"
  description: |
    Evidence that all declassification receipt consumption is normalized to PCAC-gated
    effects with durable single-use enforcement, request-scoped binding in authority
    intent digest, and non-colliding uniqueness constraints across event types.
  requirement_ids:
    - "REQ-0002"
    - "REQ-0005"
  expected_contents:
    - "No ad-hoc receipt single-consume tracking remains for declassification paths."
    - "Replay across request and across restart is denied by construction and tested."
    - "Receipt event uniqueness collisions are structurally impossible."
    - "Consumption ledger events carry replay-critical binding fields."
    - "Consumption ledger events include AdmissionBundleDigest for O(1) correlation."
