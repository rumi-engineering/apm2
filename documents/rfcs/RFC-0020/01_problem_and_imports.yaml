      The central failure mode addressed by RFC-0020 is interface entropy under recursive
      holonic composition: authority semantics, context boundaries, and verification obligations
      drift across agents, adapters, and deployment scales.

      RFC-0020 standardizes a single substrate interface where:
      - identity is self-certifying and proof-carrying,
      - capabilities are explicit and non-discoverable,
      - actuation is receipt-bound and evidence-addressed,
      - cross-holon communication is digest-first,
      - and high-volume verification remains tractable at exabyte scale.

      The RFC explicitly targets globally distributed, recursively nested holarchies where
      message semantics must remain stable whether one holon coordinates a 1-line change
      or a federation-scale deployment graph.
