  title: "RoleSpec launch contract hash-binding and fail-closed admission checks"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    FAC CLI role launch surfaces MUST require explicit hash bindings for role, context,
    policy snapshot, and work identity, and MUST deny launch on missing/stale/unverifiable
    bindings prior to authoritative actuation.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00449.
  rationale: |
    Authority-bearing launch cannot depend on implicit or mutable context; launch-time
    admissibility must be bound to replayable hash commitments.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "CLI launch command requires role_spec_hash, work_id, and context/policy hash bindings."
    - "Launch denies by default on missing, stale, ambiguous, or unverifiable bindings."
    - "Launch receipts bind hash commitments and can be independently replay-verified."
    - "Admission checks run before any authoritative tool actuation."
