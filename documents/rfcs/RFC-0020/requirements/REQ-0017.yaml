  id: "REQ-0017"
  title: "ReceiptPointer and multiproof acceptance equivalence"
  category: "FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    ReceiptPointerV1 and ReceiptMultiProofV1 MUST allow authoritative receipt verification from receipt bytes, seal, and inclusion proof without ledger search and preserve equivalent acceptance semantics to direct signature paths.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00363
  rationale: |
    Cross-holon evidence exchange requires compact pointers with deterministic verifier behavior.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Cross-holon authoritative receipt references use ReceiptPointer by default"
    - "Multiproof validation yields deterministic membership results"
    - "Behavioral acceptance equivalence documented and tested"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00363 is completed with linked evidence."
