  schema_version: "2026-02-05"
  id: "REQ-0027"
  title: "Permeability authority lattice meet enforcement"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Permeability delegation MUST be admitted only when delegated authority equals D=meet(A,O) over AuthorityVectorV1 dimensions across risk, capabilities, budgets, stop predicates, attestation floor, taint, classification, expiry, and federation caps; PermeabilityReceiptV1 MUST carry authority_overlay_hash (or inline hashed overlay), and delegated episodes/authoritative receipts MUST bind permeability_receipt_hash; missing, unverifiable, expired, or revoked delegation receipts MUST deny actuation.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00373
  rationale: |
    Strict-subset delegation is only enforceable through a machine-checkable meet algorithm.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Delegation widening attempts are denied"
    - "Meet algorithm deterministic across implementations"
    - "PermeabilityReceipt admission enforces D == meet(A, O) and rejects unverifiable overlays"
    - "Delegated envelopes and receipts always bind permeability_receipt_hash"
    - "Negative tests cover recursion depth >=4 laundering attempts"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00373 is completed with linked evidence."
