  title: "Canonical key identifier formats"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    PublicKeyIdV1, KeySetIdV1, CellIdV1, HolonIdV1, and SPIFFE-like identity text forms MUST define strict canonical text and binary forms, bounded length, and parser conformance vectors rejecting non-canonical encodings; any *_quorum_id MUST resolve to KeySetDescriptorV1 via digest-first lookup.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00353
  rationale: |
    Self-certifying identity trust starts at canonical key identifier determinism.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Canonical parser rejects mixed case/whitespace/non-canonical encodings, percent-decoding tricks, and Unicode normalization variants"
    - "Binary and text identity forms round-trip losslessly"
    - "Any referenced *_quorum_id resolves to a canonical KeySetDescriptorV1 object in CAS"
    - "Cross-language conformance vectors are stable"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00353 is completed with linked evidence."
