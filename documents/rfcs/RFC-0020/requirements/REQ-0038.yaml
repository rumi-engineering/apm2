  title: "Markov-blanket authoritative channel enforcement and no-bypass actuation"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Launch-driven authoritative execution MUST enforce Markov-blanket channel boundaries:
    only typed tool-intent channel events are admissible as authority inputs and all
    authoritative effects MUST traverse broker + capability + context-firewall checks.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00450.
  rationale: |
    Treating free-form model output as authority input creates bypass and injection surfaces;
    typed boundary channels are required for containment and replayability.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Authoritative actuation is blocked unless sourced from typed tool-intent channel events."
    - "No bypass path exists around broker/capability/context-firewall enforcement in launch flows."
    - "Boundary violations emit structured defects and deny authoritative progression."
    - "Adversarial replay tests verify no revived side-effects through untyped channels."
