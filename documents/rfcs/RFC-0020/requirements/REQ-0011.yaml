  title: "O(log n) identity verification with bounded economics"
  category: "PERFORMANCE"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Identity membership and non-membership verification MUST remain O(log n) or better with explicit proof byte, depth, and node-count caps and benchmarked behavior for a 10^12 namespace model; verifiers MUST support head-cache amortization such that verifying K identities against one admitted head requires O(1) signature/quorum checks plus O(K log n) hashing.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00357
  rationale: |
    Asymptotic guarantees must be operationally constrained by bounded proof economics.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Verifier work class validated as O(log n) for membership and non-membership under admitted profiles"
    - "Head-cache amortization demonstrates O(1) signature/quorum checks per cached head across K identity verifications"
    - "Bound violations fail closed before memory amplification"
    - "Forged/malformed proofs consistently denied"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00357 is completed with linked evidence."
