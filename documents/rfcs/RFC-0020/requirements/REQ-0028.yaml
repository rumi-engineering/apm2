  schema_version: "2026-02-05"
  id: "REQ-0028"
  title: "Capsule containment with no ambient authority"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Tier3+ actuation MUST execute within admitted capsule profiles with namespace, seccomp, cgroup, and deny-by-default egress controls and no ambient OS authority.

    Multi-ticket delivery: TCK-00374 delivers policy types, validation logic,
    and unit tests. TCK-00375 wires AdmissionGate::check into the daemon
    actuation path. TCK-00376 ensures no-bypass path ratchet.
  rationale: |
    Containment boundaries are mandatory for safe autonomous actuation.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Tier3+ actuation executes only inside admitted capsule profile"
    - "Capsule egress defaults to deny unless policy grants explicit route"
    - "Escape attempts become blocking defects"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00374 is completed with linked evidence."
