  schema_version: "2026-02-05"
  id: "REQ-0034"
  title: "Digest-first HMP classes and admission receipts"
  category: "FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Inter-holon messaging MUST preserve WORK, EVIDENCE, and GOVERNANCE class semantics, default to digest-first payload references, and require AdmissionReceiptV1 (or ImportReceiptV1) for imported authoritative claims binding source cell_id, source anchor/range, verification method, and imported root/hash commitments.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00380
  rationale: |
    Separation of routing facts and acceptance facts is foundational for federated trust.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Routing facts and acceptance facts are operationally distinct"
    - "Authoritative imports require typed AdmissionReceiptV1/ImportReceiptV1 objects bound to evidence and source verification metadata"
    - "Unsolicited large payloads are dropped with bounded resource use"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00380 is completed with linked evidence."
  evidence_ids:
    - "EVID-0034"
  source_refs:
    - "HOLONIC_SUBSTRATE_INTERFACE.md §7.3"
    - "HOLONIC_SUBSTRATE_INTERFACE.md §2.4.0b"
    - "HOLONIC_SUBSTRATE_INTERFACE.md §8.3"
