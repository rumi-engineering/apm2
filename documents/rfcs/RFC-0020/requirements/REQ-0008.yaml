  title: "Stable self-certifying cell and holon identity derivation"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    CellIdV1 and HolonIdV1 MUST derive from CellGenesisV1 and HolonGenesisV1 commitments such that operational key rotation preserves identity continuity.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00354
  rationale: |
    Stable IDs preserve audit graph continuity and delegation chain integrity.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "ID derivation deterministic and collision-resistant under declared hash profile"
    - "Rotation events preserve stable IDs"
    - "Genesis artifacts are hash-addressed in CAS"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00354 is completed with linked evidence."
