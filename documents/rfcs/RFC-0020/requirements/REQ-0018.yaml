  title: "FreshnessPolicy HTF authority"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    FreshnessPolicyV1 MUST evaluate staleness using HTF and ledger-anchor lag authority inputs; remote wall-clock deltas and direct cross-cell remote-tick comparisons are forbidden for authorization semantics; Tier2+ missing/stale/ambiguous freshness authority MUST deny actuation; EpisodeEnvelopeV1 MUST bind FreshnessPinsetV1 (or equivalent deterministic pinset commitment) for reproducibility-critical inputs.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00364
  rationale: |
    Authoritative freshness requires deterministic time authority resistant to clock manipulation.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Tier2+ stale heads deny authoritative actions"
    - "Policy evaluator uses HTF-compatible lag authority only"
    - "Cross-cell freshness evaluation does not rely on remote monotonic tick comparison"
    - "Episode envelopes bind freshness pinset commitments used for replay/audit validation"
    - "Staleness outcomes are deterministic and auditable"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00364 is completed with linked evidence."
