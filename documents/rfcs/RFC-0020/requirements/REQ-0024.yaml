  title: "FactRoot composition with RFC-0014 BFT checkpoints"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    BFT cells MUST compose receipt batch roots into quorum-certified checkpoint structures through FactRootV1; BFT-mode ReceiptPointerV1 MUST support fact_root_proof plus qc_pointer authentication path; ReceiptBatchDescriptorV1 and FactInclusionProofV1 verification data MUST be sufficient to authenticate included facts without ad hoc ledger search; unauthenticated high-volume roots MUST be rejected for authoritative admission.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00370
  rationale: |
    Reuse of consensus proof work is essential to maintain verification economics under scale.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "BFT-mode batch roots are checkpoint-composed by default"
    - "Verifier supports QC + FactRoot proof path, including fact_root_proof + qc_pointer in receipt pointers"
    - "Batch descriptors and fact inclusion proofs are deterministic and sufficient for verifier replay"
    - "Free-floating batch roots are not accepted for authority"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00370 is completed with linked evidence."
