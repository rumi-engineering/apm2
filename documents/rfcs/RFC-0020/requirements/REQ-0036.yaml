  schema_version: "2026-02-05"
  id: "REQ-0036"
  title: "Business continuity and stop-path safety objectives"
  category: "RELIABILITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Cells MUST meet defined RPO and RTO targets, execute and receipt disaster and partition drills as DrillReceiptV1 artifacts (binding scenario id/version, observed failure modes, recovery time, stop-order failure count, and supporting evidence references), and satisfy stop-path SLOs including p99 stop propagation <=2s and stop uncertainty deny <=250ms for Tier3+.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00382
  rationale: |
    Civilizational-scale claims require measurable disaster recovery and safety-loop performance.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Stop-path SLO violations trigger automated fail-safe actions"
    - "Chaos/partition drills emit DrillReceiptV1 with required bindings and auditable evidence references"
    - "Formal artifacts are required inputs for stage promotion gates"
    - "Cross-cell governance stop/rotation operations are authenticated and auditable"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00382 is completed with linked evidence."
