  title: "Optional VDF delay profile correctness"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P2"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    When enabled, VDF profiles MUST derive deterministic challenges from cell_id, prior_epoch_root, and quorum_anchor and produce verifiable outputs bound into epoch seals.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00366
  rationale: |
    Optional delay hardening must remain deterministic and non-disruptive while increasing adversarial cost.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "VDF profile can be enabled per-link/per-cell policy"
    - "Forged/non-monotone VDF evidence is rejected deterministically"
    - "Epoch seal verification remains bounded when VDF is enabled"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00366 is completed with linked evidence."
