  title: "Functorial composition law for rewrite admission"
  category: "FORMAL"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Optimization rewrites MUST be admitted only when they satisfy functorial observation-law constraints over the bounded model and preserve composition semantics.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00368
  rationale: |
    Category-theoretic rewrite constraints provide an explicit correctness contract for optimization admission.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Admitted rewrite catalog references proof obligations"
    - "Non-proven rewrites are blocked from release pipelines"
    - "Optimization does not change observable HSI truth semantics"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00368 is completed with linked evidence."
