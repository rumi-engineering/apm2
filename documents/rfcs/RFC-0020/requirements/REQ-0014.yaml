  title: "Revocation-wins signed CRDT convergence"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Directory convergence MUST implement revocation-wins signed CRDT merge semantics and require explicit re-admission anchors before any revoked identity can become active again.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00360
  rationale: |
    Revocation races are a primary partition-time threat; monotone revocation semantics close that class.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Concurrent updates converge deterministically"
    - "Revoked identities cannot resurrect without explicit re-admission proof"
    - "Byzantine ordering does not violate revocation-wins law"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00360 is completed with linked evidence."
