  title: "Pre-actuation stop and budget proof obligations"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Stop conditions and typed budgets MUST be evaluated before tool actuation and represented by explicit receipt evidence or mandatory receipt fields proving precondition evaluation order.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00351
  rationale: |
    Safety-critical gating requires proving preconditions before side effects.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "No tool actuation occurs without prior stop/budget evaluation"
    - "Replay harness verifies ordering invariants"
    - "Stop uncertainty triggers deny in configured deadline path"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00351 is completed with linked evidence."
