  title: "Attestation overhead contract and fallback"
  category: "PERFORMANCE"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    For RFC-0014 BFT cells, batching MUST meet <=1 percent p99 CPU and network overhead targets versus baseline (measured over >=10^6 effects with 10^8 runs and 10^12 projections) and MUST auto-fallback to direct verification when performance, integrity, or freshness gates fail.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00372
  rationale: |
    Scalability contracts must be measurable and safe under degradation.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Overhead measurements captured at 10^6 and 10^8 scales with documented 10^12 projection and within gate budgets"
    - "Fallback path activates automatically on integrity/freshness/perf failure"
    - "Fallback behavior preserves acceptance semantics"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00372 is completed with linked evidence."
