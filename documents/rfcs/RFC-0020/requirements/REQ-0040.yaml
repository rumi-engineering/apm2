  title: "Auditor and orchestrator projections for launch lineage and uncertainty"
  category: "OBSERVABILITY"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    FAC launch execution MUST expose auditor- and orchestrator-facing projection surfaces
    that report lineage completeness, liveness state, restart counters, and uncertainty flags
    from receipt-backed facts rather than transcript inspection.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00452.
  rationale: |
    Operational control and governance require stable projection interfaces over receipts,
    not ad-hoc process introspection.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Auditor projection surfaces provide receipt-chain completeness and boundary-conformance indicators."
    - "Orchestrator projection surfaces provide active run count, last receipt tick, restart counters, and uncertainty flags."
    - "Projection responses are digest-first and replay-consistent across observers."
    - "Missing lineage data is surfaced as explicit non-admissible uncertainty."
