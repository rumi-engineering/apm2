  schema_version: "2026-02-05"
  id: "REQ-0006"
  title: "Policy-only capability minting and non-discoverability"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    CapabilityManifestV1 MUST be minted only by policy resolver or admissible permeability delegation; requester-authored manifests are forbidden; broker MUST enforce scope, host, path, and quantitative constraints fail-closed.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00352
  rationale: |
    Authority laundering prevention depends on strict origin and scope enforcement for capability artifacts.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Capability manifests cannot be minted by requester surfaces"
    - "Out-of-scope tool/path/host attempts denied with defects"
    - "Envelope-manifest hash mismatch always denies actuation"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00352 is completed with linked evidence."
