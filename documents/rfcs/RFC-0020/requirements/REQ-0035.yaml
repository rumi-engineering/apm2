  title: "Anti-entropy boundedness and budgeted backpressure"
  category: "RELIABILITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Federation anti-entropy MUST remain pull-only and budget-bound across episode, cell, and relay scopes; budget exceedance MUST deny further actuation and emit defects.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00381
  rationale: |
    Bounded replication and backpressure are required to preserve liveness and containment under load.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Anti-entropy delivery is strictly pull-based and bounded"
    - "Byzantine relay behaviors cannot force authority acceptance"
    - "Partition/rejoin converges under revocation-wins semantics"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00381 is completed with linked evidence."
