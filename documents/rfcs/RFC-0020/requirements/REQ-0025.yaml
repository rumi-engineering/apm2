  title: "Hierarchical batch forest commitments"
  category: "PERFORMANCE"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Implementations MUST support BatchEpochRootV1 root-of-roots commitments enabling bounded verification of receipts across batch and epoch levels.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00371
  rationale: |
    Hierarchical commitments prevent proof traversal explosion over long-running high-volume histories.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Hierarchical roots are deterministic and content-addressed"
    - "Verifier can traverse root-of-roots with bounded memory"
    - "Anti-entropy advertisements can reference epoch roots directly"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00371 is completed with linked evidence."
