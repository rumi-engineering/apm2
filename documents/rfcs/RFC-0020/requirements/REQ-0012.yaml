  title: "IdentityProofProfile pinning and compatibility"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    IdentityProofProfileV1 MUST declare proof and verifier contracts and be hash-pinned in directory heads; unknown or mismatched profiles MUST fail closed for Tier2+ authority paths.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00358
  rationale: |
    Profile pinning prevents proof-format ambiguity and cross-implementation parser drift.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Profile hash mismatch blocks authoritative verification"
    - "Session-open path records active proof profile hash"
    - "Unsupported profiles are rejected deterministically"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00358 is completed with linked evidence."
