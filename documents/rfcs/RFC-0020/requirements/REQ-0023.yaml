  id: "REQ-0023"
  title: "Active inference objective remains advisory"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Bounded expected free energy objectives MAY guide coordination planning but MUST NOT authorize effects without independent capability, stop, freshness, and attestation gate approval; Tier3+ repeated escalation loops MUST emit CoordinationObjectiveReceiptV1 (or equivalent) with objective inputs bound by hash.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00369
  rationale: |
    Planner heuristics cannot become implicit authority channels.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Planner output cannot directly authorize actuation"
    - "Gate checks remain authoritative under all planner outcomes"
    - "Tier3+ repeated escalations emit CoordinationObjectiveReceiptV1 with hash-addressed objective inputs"
    - "Advisory objective outputs are auditable in receipts/logs"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00369 is completed with linked evidence."
