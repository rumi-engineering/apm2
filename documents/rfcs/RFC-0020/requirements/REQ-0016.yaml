  title: "AuthoritySeal unified fact authentication"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    AuthoritySealV1 MUST authenticate facts in SINGLE_SIG, QUORUM_MULTISIG/QUORUM_THRESHOLD, and MERKLE_BATCH modes with domain-separated preimages, mandatory ledger-anchor semantics, and Tier2+/governance time-envelope requirements for authoritative acceptance.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00362
  rationale: |
    Unified fact-authentication semantics reduce verifier complexity and remove free-floating signature ambiguity.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "AuthoritySeal verifies direct, quorum, threshold, and Merkle-batch authenticated facts"
    - "Unsigned/free-floating batch roots are rejected for authority use"
    - "Domain separation tags and issuer key/quorum identifiers are required and validated"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00362 is completed with linked evidence."
