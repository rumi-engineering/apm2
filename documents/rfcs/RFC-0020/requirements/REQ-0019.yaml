  title: "EpochSeal monotonic federation freshness"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    EpochSealV1 MUST provide monotonic freshness commitments for directory heads, permeability grants, and receipt-batch epoch artifacts; Tier2+ cross-cell authority admissions MUST require a valid EpochSealV1 (or equivalent quorum-certified HTF envelope), and non-monotone, conflicting, or missing seals MUST deny admission.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00365
  rationale: |
    Federation freshness must be robust to replay and equivocation under partitions.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Epoch seals issued for configured freshness-critical artifacts including directory heads and authority-bearing delegation/batch paths"
    - "Admission path rejects non-monotone or conflicting epoch sequences"
    - "Tier2+ authority admissions fail closed on missing/invalid seals"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00365 is completed with linked evidence."
