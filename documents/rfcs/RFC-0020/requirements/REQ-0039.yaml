  title: "Launch lifecycle liveness pulse and bounded restart policy"
  category: "RELIABILITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Role-launch execution MUST emit deterministic liveness pulse receipts, enforce bounded
    restart policy, and publish terminal reason taxonomy so stalled or ambiguous runs deny
    authoritative progression instead of remaining indeterminate.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00451.
  rationale: |
    Without deterministic liveness semantics, authority-bearing launch flows can deadlock or
    silently degrade under fault conditions.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Liveness pulse receipts include run identity, time anchor, and health verdict fields."
    - "Restart policy is bounded and emits explicit reason-coded transitions."
    - "Ambiguous liveness state denies authoritative progression with structured defect output."
    - "Terminal reason taxonomy is stable and consumable by gate/orchestrator logic."
