  schema_version: "2026-02-05"
  id: "REQ-0009"
  title: "Certificate hierarchy and session-key delegation"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    CellCertificateV1, HolonCertificateV1, and SessionKeyDelegationV1 MUST enforce non-overlapping root, operational, and session key roles with explicit validity and authority bindings.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00355
  rationale: |
    Role-separated key hierarchy minimizes blast radius and supports controlled key lifecycle operations.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Certificate verification checks bindings and expiry constraints"
    - "Session key delegation bounded by operational key authority"
    - "Role overlap between root/operational/session keys is rejected"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00355 is completed with linked evidence."
