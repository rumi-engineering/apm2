  title: "Bisimulation gate for recursion depth N<=12"
  category: "FORMAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    The project MUST maintain a machine-checkable bisimulation artifact proving observational equivalence between nested holon composition and flattened execution for recursion depth N<=12.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00367
  rationale: |
    Bounded formal equivalence is required to preserve recursion semantics during optimization and rollout.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Model artifact checks observational equivalence for N<=12"
    - "Counterexamples are emitted as blocking defects"
    - "Gate integration blocks promotion on proof failure"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00367 is completed with linked evidence."
