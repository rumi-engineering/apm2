  schema_version: "2026-02-05"
  id: "REQ-0013"
  title: "Verifier cache safety contract"
  category: "PERFORMANCE"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Verifiers MUST support cache amortization from verified heads across multiple identity checks and MUST invalidate deterministically on revocation, rotation, and head advancement.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00359
  rationale: |
    Cache reuse is required for throughput, but stale cache safety is non-negotiable for security.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Cache reuse measurably reduces repeated verification cost"
    - "Stale cache entries cannot authorize revoked identities"
    - "Invalidation path is deterministic and auditable"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00359 is completed with linked evidence."
