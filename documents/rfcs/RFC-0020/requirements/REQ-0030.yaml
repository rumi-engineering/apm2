  schema_version: "2026-02-05"
  id: "REQ-0030"
  title: "No bypass actuation paths"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Tool execution paths MUST always traverse broker, capability, and context firewall checks; missing enforcement dependencies MUST deny actuation by default.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00376
  rationale: |
    Any bypass path invalidates proof-carrying security guarantees.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "No actuation path bypasses broker and policy checks"
    - "Unavailable enforcement dependency causes deny, never permissive fallback"
    - "Regression suite prevents bypass reintroduction"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00376 is completed with linked evidence."
