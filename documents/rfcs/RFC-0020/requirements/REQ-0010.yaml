  schema_version: "2026-02-05"
  id: "REQ-0010"
  title: "Directory head and identity proof artifacts"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Boundary-crossing identity values MUST be accompanied by proof-carrying pointers via HolonDirectoryHeadV1, IdentityProofV1, and DirectoryProofV1; unverifiable identity claims MUST be rejected for authoritative actions.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00356
  rationale: |
    Identity at scale requires verifiable membership semantics without registry scans.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Identity-bearing messages include identity_proof_hash pointers"
    - "Directory head hashes resolve to signed/authenticated head artifacts"
    - "Unproofed identity values rejected for authoritative operations"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00356 is completed with linked evidence."
