  title: "Dual lattice taint and confidentiality enforcement"
  category: "SECURITY"
  priority: "P1"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Runtime policy MUST propagate taint and confidentiality labels through context, tool, and evidence flows and require explicit declassification receipts for confidentiality downgrades.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00378
  rationale: |
    Dual-lattice semantics preserve integrity and confidentiality simultaneously under recursion.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Tier3+ actuators reject untrusted or over-confidential inputs"
    - "Declassification requires explicit policy and receipt emission"
    - "Secret leakage adversarial tests pass"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00378 is completed with linked evidence."
