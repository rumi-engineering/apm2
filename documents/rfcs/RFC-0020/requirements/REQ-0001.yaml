  title: "HSIContractManifest deterministic generation and semantics coverage"
  category: "FUNCTIONAL"
  priority: "P0"
  status: "PROPOSED"
  statement: |
    Implementations MUST generate HSIContractManifestV1 deterministically from daemon and CLI dispatch metadata; build pipelines MUST fail when authoritative routes lack semantics annotations; manifest bytes and hash outputs MUST be reproducible across equivalent builds.

    Primary delivery ticket: TCK-00347
  rationale: |
    Deterministic contract materialization is required to prevent interface drift across recursive holons and to make handshake compatibility machine-checkable.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Manifest generation deterministic across repeat builds"
    - "Missing route semantics annotation fails CI/build"
    - "Golden hash fixture tests pass"
    - "Primary implementation ticket TCK-00347 is completed with linked evidence."
