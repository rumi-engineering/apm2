    RFC-0020 specifies the Holonic Substrate Interface (HSI): a minimal, versioned, content-addressed
    syscall surface for all holonic agents via the apm2 CLI + apm2-daemon control plane.

    This RFC introduces two verifiable contracts that close the "agents don't know the tools" gap:
    (1) HSIContractManifestV1 (static syscall schema), and (2) CapabilityManifestV1 (dynamic, delegated
    authority + budgets). Both are stored as CAS artifacts and referenced by hash in episode start
    events, receipts, and ContextPacks.

    The RFC additionally hardens civilizational-scale federation mechanics with:
    - explicit canonical identity grammar + self-certifying IDs,
    - O(log n) identity proof profiles for 10^12-holon namespaces,
    - Merkle/epoch hierarchical attestation batching with <1% BFT overhead gates,
    - HTF-anchored epoch sealing (optional VDF delay proofs) for anti-replay freshness.

    The RFC also defines Agent Capsules: a contained execution environment where the agent runtime
    has no ambient OS authority, and the only actuator is apm2-mediated tool execution.

    Finally, the RFC integrates HSI/HMP with the Forge Admission Cycle (FAC) by defining:
    - pulse semantics as wakeups (never truth),
    - digest-first inter-holon messaging bound to ledger commitments,
    - ContextPack "malloc" semantics via ContextPack + ContextDelta.
