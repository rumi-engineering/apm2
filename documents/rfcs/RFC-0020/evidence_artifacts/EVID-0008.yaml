    Evidence that CellGenesisV1 and HolonGenesisV1 artifacts satisfy
    REQ-0008 AC#3 by using canonical genesis bytes as CAS content, storing
    through filesystem-backed DurableCas, retrieving by content hash, and
    proving idempotent deduplication on repeated store.

        Durable CAS conformance tests verify:
        - CellGenesisV1 canonical bytes are stored in DurableCas using TempDir-backed isolation
        - first store result is new and reports expected size
        - retrieve by content hash returns byte-identical canonical bytes
        - second store of identical bytes is deduplicated (is_new = false)
        - HolonGenesisV1 validates the same hash-addressed store/retrieve/dedup flow
