    Evidence bundle for REQ-0005 showing pre-actuation stop/budget
    proof behavior and production governance freshness wiring coverage for
    TCK-00351 (PR #456). The covered behaviors include periodic governance
    freshness checks, probe success/failure signaling, and replay proof
    semantics for deferred budget enforcement.
