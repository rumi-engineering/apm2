  title: "Coordination evidence receipts"
  statement: |
    Coordination MUST produce structured evidence receipts (receipt.coordination)
    proving execution outcomes. Receipts MUST include: coordination_id, work_outcomes
    (per-item success/failure), budget_usage (consumed vs ceiling), stop_condition,
    timing (started_at, completed_at), and session counts (total, successful, failed).
    Receipts MUST be stored in CAS and referenced in coordination completion events.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Receipt includes all required fields. Verified by: Schema validation of emitted receipts."
    - "Work outcomes per item. Verified by: Receipt contains outcome entry for each work item attempted."
    - "Budget usage tracked. Verified by: Receipt shows consumed_episodes, elapsed_ms, and budget ceilings."
    - "Receipt stored in CAS. Verified by: CAS lookup by hash succeeds after coordination completion."
    - "Receipt referenced in completion event. Verified by: coordination.completed event includes receipt_hash."
