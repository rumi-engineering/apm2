  title: Deterministic reconciliation and conflict resolution
  statement: 'The system MUST resolve lease conflicts post-partition using a deterministic
    reducer rule based on Canonical Root selection and Registrar Authority.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Post-merge, the system determines the authoritative registrar for the work scope
    based on the Canonical Root (determined by closed membership).
  - Any lease not issued by the authoritative registrar is identified as a conflict
    (LEASE.CONFLICT_DETECTED).
  - Conflicts are resolved deterministically (LEASE.CONFLICT_RESOLVED), with the losing
    attempt transitioning to ABORTED_CONFLICT.
    - All evidence produced by the losing attempt is preserved for audit and potential
      manual integration.
  - Startup reconciliation consults authoritative token-ledger nonce state for orphaned
    claimed work carrying single-use actuation authority (for example, channel-context
    tokens): consumed/revoked or unverifiable nonce state MUST route to deterministic
    terminal denied outcome; fresh nonce state MAY requeue.
