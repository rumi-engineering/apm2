  title: Entropy-based session termination (Crash-Only)
  statement: 'The system MUST monitor session entropy (errors, stalls, violations)
    and terminate sessions that exceed their budget, forcing a clean respawn from
    the immutable ledger.'
  acceptance_criteria:
  - "Supervisor tracks entropy signals: repeated tool failures, policy violations, and lack of progress."
  - "Exceeding the entropy budget triggers a SESSION.ENTROPY_EXCEEDED event and immediate termination."
  - "Recovery is performed by a new session replaying the ledger state from a valid cursor."
  - "No attempt is made to fix or repair a corrupted internal session state."
