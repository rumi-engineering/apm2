  description: |
    This directory contains individual requirement files for the Forge Admission Cycle (FAC)
    PRD. Each requirement is stored in a separate YAML file following the prd_requirement
    schema. FAC governs the hardened promotion protocol from changeset ingestion through
    cryptographically-enforced admission to trunk, with projection-only GitHub sync.

    requirements:
      - id: "REQ-0009"
        title: "Signed GateRunCompleted"
        rationale: "FAC relies on cryptographically signed gate outcomes for admission decisions"
