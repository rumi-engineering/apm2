  title: "Risk-tiered AAT selection policy"
  statement: |
    AAT selection MUST be risk-tiered and diff-aware to preserve throughput while
    protecting high-risk changes. GateReceipt MUST record risk_tier and
    selection_policy_id bound to policy_hash.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Policy defines HIGH/MED/LOW tiers with explicit selection rules. Verified by: Policy schema test."
    - "GateReceipt payload includes risk_tier and selection_policy_id. Verified by: Payload validation test."
    - "HIGH tier requires AAT; MED/LOW follow sampling rules with nightly full AAT on main. Verified by: Policy enforcement tests."
    - "Admission rejects mismatched selection_policy_id with AAT_POLICY_MISMATCH. Verified by: Negative test."
