      statement: All selectors MUST be resolved to concrete git object IDs (commit/tree); no symbolic HEAD.
      rationale: |
        Symbolic references can resolve to different commits at different times, breaking
        reproducibility and enabling TOCTOU attacks on admission decisions.
      enforcement: FAC-00-INGEST_CHANGESET rejects INVALID_SELECTOR if symbolic references are not resolved.

    - id: CNS-0002
      statement: Workspace deltas MUST be content-addressed artifacts; never inferred from disk.
      rationale: |
        Disk state is mutable and non-deterministic. Content-addressing ensures changesets
        are immutable and verifiable.
      enforcement: FAC-00-INGEST_CHANGESET rejects UNPINNED_INPUTS if workspace delta is not CAS-stored.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0001
    - id: CNS-0003
      statement: CAS-at-commit ordering MUST be enforced; changeset_digest bound to work_id before gate spawning.
      rationale: |
        Prevents race conditions where gates evaluate uncommitted or different changesets
        than the one being admitted.
      enforcement: Coordinator verifies ledger binding before session.spawn.

    - id: CNS-0004
      statement: CI observations are never treated as authoritative admission signals.
      rationale: |
        External CI systems can be spoofed or manipulated. FAC treats CI outputs as
        evidence artifacts, not admission decisions.
      enforcement: FAC-01-CI_EVIDENCE_IMPORT requires evidence import; plain 'success' conclusion is ignored.

      statement: |
        READY_FOR_REVIEW transition requires: (a) webhook signature verified, (b) raw
        log/artifact digests imported into CAS, (c) adapter attestation signed and committed.
      rationale: |
        Prevents attackers from triggering review without legitimate CI evidence backing.
      enforcement: FAC-01-CI_EVIDENCE_IMPORT rejects CI_EVIDENCE_MISSING if requirements not met.

      statement: |
        repo.read and file.read operations MUST reference a manifest entry (stable_id or
        path+hash) present in the ContextPackManifest allowlist.
      rationale: |
        Context firewall ensures consumption holons cannot perform open-ended discovery,
        maintaining deterministic and bounded execution.
      enforcement: ToolDecided=DENY if not allowlisted (rule_id CTX-ALLOWLIST-001).
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0003
    - id: CNS-0007
      statement: |
        Consumers may request additional context only via ContextRefinementRequest, which
        terminates current session and triggers pack recompilation; no in-session discovery.
      rationale: |
        Prevents unbounded context expansion during execution. Forces systematic improvement
        of pack compilation rather than runtime workarounds.
      enforcement: SessionTerminated rationale=CONTEXT_MISS; coordinator reissues lease after refined pack.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0004
    - id: CNS-0008
      statement: |
        Every RunReceipt MUST record context sufficiency metrics (bytes supplied, entries
        used, misses, denied reads, ZTI score).
      rationale: |
        Enables measurement of pack quality and systematic improvement. RunReceipt is
        required for GateRunCompleted acceptance.
      enforcement: RunReceipt validation rejects missing sufficiency metrics.
      evidence_ids:

      statement: |
        GateLease scope is strict: (work_id, gate_id, changeset_digest, executor_actor_id,
        expiry, policy_hash). Lease derivation obeys subset rule.
      rationale: |
        Prevents privilege escalation via lease manipulation. Child leases can only narrow
        scope, never broaden.
      enforcement: LEASE_SCOPE_BROADENED defect on subset rule violation; lease rejected.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0007
    - id: CNS-0010
      statement: Lease issuance MUST be committed before session.spawn (CAS-at-commit ordering).
      rationale: |
        Ensures gate execution has cryptographically verifiable authority before it begins.
        Prevents unauthorized gate execution.
      enforcement: Coordinator verifies ledger contains GateLeaseIssued before spawning.

      statement: |
        GateRunCompleted is a critical signed event (Ed25519 over canonical bytes,
        domain-separated with GATE_RUN_COMPLETED: prefix).
      rationale: |
        Cryptographic signatures prevent spoofing and ensure non-repudiation of gate
        outcomes.
      enforcement: Signature verification on ingestion; INVALID_SIGNATURE rejects.

        - EVID-0001
    - id: CNS-0012
      statement: Admission reads only internal projections; never reads GitHub status as truth.
      rationale: |
        GitHub is a projection target, not a source of truth. Reading GitHub status would
        allow external manipulation of admission decisions.
      enforcement: Code review and policy enforcement; no GitHub status reads in admission path.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0001
    - id: CNS-0013
      statement: |
        MergeReceipt is emitted only after result_selector (trunk digest) is observed and
        recorded, ensuring atomic merge semantics.
      rationale: |
        Prevents MergeReceipt emission for failed merges. Ensures cryptographic binding
        of merge outcome.
      enforcement: MERGE_NONATOMIC defect if result_selector not observed.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0002
    - id: CNS-0014
      statement: Sync direction is always ledger -> GitHub; projection is idempotent.
      rationale: |
        Single source of truth (ledger) prevents split-brain scenarios. Idempotence
        ensures safe retries.
      enforcement: Adapter enforces write direction; repeated sync yields same state.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0005
    - id: CNS-0015
      statement: |
        Adapter is the only identity permitted to write GitHub checks/status/labels/comments.
        Other writers are treated as tamper.
      rationale: |
        Single writer prevents confusion about authoritative status. Tamper detection
        enables security response.
      enforcement: PROJECTION_TAMPER defect on non-adapter writes; overwrite on next sync.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0005
    - id: CNS-0016
      statement: |
        Continuous divergence detection: compare external trunk HEAD to latest MergeReceipt
        result_selector; if diverged, emit PROJECTION_DIVERGENCE and freeze admissions.
      rationale: |
        Detects external tampering or uncontrolled merges. Freezing prevents admission
        of changes to corrupted state.
      enforcement: Watchdog polls every 30 seconds; InterventionFreeze on divergence.

        - EVID-0005
    - id: CNS-0017
      statement: |
        Holdout ChangeSets are isolated from production trunk (no merge capability);
        if false-negative rate exceeds threshold, gate policy is quarantined.
      rationale: |
        Holdouts measure evaluator quality without affecting production. Quarantine
        prevents use of degraded policies.
      enforcement: FAC-90 holdout execution; policy quarantine on threshold breach.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0010
    - id: CNS-0018
      statement: |
        GateReceipt MUST support typed payloads; when gate_id=aat, payload MUST include
        view_commitment_hash, determinism_class, run_receipt_hashes, run_count, stability_digest,
        and verdict, all bound to the EvidenceBundle hash.
      rationale: |
        Typed payloads keep admission logic single-path while allowing AAT-specific
        acceptance contracts to be enforced without parallel receipt types.
      enforcement: GateReceipt validation rejects missing fields for gate_id=aat.

        - EVID-0020
    - id: CNS-0019
      statement: |
        When determinism_class > 0, gate outcomes MUST be validated under a coordinator-
        managed determinism envelope requiring N identical runs before PASS.
      rationale: |
        Prevents gate flakiness from compromising admission integrity; removes executor
        self-attestation of stability.
      enforcement: GATE_NONDETERMINISTIC defect emitted; WorkTransitioned rationale=QUARANTINED_CHANGESET and WorkAborted abort_reason=POLICY_DENY after threshold.

      statement: |
        AAT GateReceipt payload MUST bind transcript_chain_root_hash, transcript_bundle_hash,
        artifact_digests, terminal_verifier_outputs, and minimum attestation fields.
      rationale: |
        Prevents spoofed AAT PASS by requiring raw, independently verifiable evidence and
        environment binding.
      enforcement: AAT_EVIDENCE_MISSING or AAT_ATTESTATION_INVALID defect on missing fields; admission rejects.

    - id: CNS-0021
      statement: |
        Terminal verifier binding is schema-enforced: for each scenario_type, allowed verifier kinds,
        required outputs, and machine predicates MUST be present for PASS.
      rationale: |
        Prevents narrative-based gate passes and Goodhart drift toward non-terminal signals.
      enforcement: AAT_TERMINAL_VERIFIER_MISSING or AAT_TERMINAL_VERIFIER_MISMATCH defect; PASS denied.

        - EVID-0023
    - id: CNS-0022
      statement: |
        AAT selection is risk-tiered and policy-bound; GateReceipt MUST include risk_tier and
        selection_policy_id matching policy_hash.
      rationale: |
        Preserves throughput while ensuring high-risk changes always receive AAT coverage.
      enforcement: AAT_POLICY_MISMATCH defect on mismatch; admission blocked.
      evidence_ids:
        - EVID-0024
    - id: CNS-0023
      statement: |
        AAT failures MUST be classified into PRODUCT_DETERMINISTIC_FAIL, HARNESS_FLAKE,
        ENVIRONMENT_DRIFT, TEST_NONSEMANTIC, or UNKNOWN with policy-specific handling.
      rationale: |
        Classification prevents wasteful retries and avoids throughput collapse.
      enforcement: UNKNOWN => NEEDS_INPUT; HARNESS_FLAKE quarantines runner pool; TEST_NONSEMANTIC quarantines test spec.

    - id: CNS-0024
      statement: |
        AAT GateLease scope MUST bind view_commitment_hash, rcp_aat_manifest_hash, and
        selection_policy_id; AAT executor keys must be in a distinct custody domain.
      rationale: |
        Prevents orchestrator or implementer roles from spoofing AAT outcomes and ensures
        runs occur against pinned snapshots.
      enforcement: UNAUTHORIZED_EXECUTOR or AAT_POLICY_MISMATCH defect; lease rejected on custody violation.

    - id: CNS-0025
      statement: |
        AAT specifications MUST be invariant-first: invariants are mandatory; steps are
        observational and cannot be acceptance predicates.
      rationale: |
        Prevents brittle step scripts from blocking legitimate refactors and encourages
        stable product-level guarantees.
      enforcement: Spec validation rejects AAT suites lacking invariant declarations with AAT_SPEC_INVALID defect.

      statement: |
        An autonomous agent cannot flip a gate outcome or merge by manipulating GitHub
        or xtask; it must produce signed internal events and receipts.
      rationale: |
        Core FAC guarantee. All admission authority flows through cryptographically
        signed internal events.
      enforcement: Signature verification, lease validation, OCAP containment.

      statement: |
        A GateRun cannot proceed with missing context; it terminates and triggers pack
        refinement.
      rationale: |
        Context misses indicate compiler failures, not execution necessities. System
        improves through refinement, not workarounds.
      enforcement: SessionTerminated rationale=CONTEXT_MISS; refinement loop.

      statement: |
        All critical events (GateLeaseIssued, GateRunCompleted, MergeReceipt) are signed
        with Ed25519 using domain-separated signatures.
      rationale: |
        Cryptographic non-repudiation and integrity. Domain separation prevents
        cross-context signature reuse.

      statement: |
        GitHub is a projection target; it is never a source of truth. Sync direction
        is always ledger -> GitHub.
      rationale: |
        Single source of truth prevents split-brain and external manipulation. GitHub
        reflects internal state, not vice versa.

        Executor of a required gate must not be the author of the ChangeSet (or a key
        in the same COI group).
      rationale: |
        Conflict of interest prevention. Self-review is not permitted for admission-
        gating reviews.
      enforcement: COI check at lease issuance; waiver requires explicit adjudication.

      statement: |
        All leases are single-use with enforced expiry. GateRunCompleted must reference
        lease_id and include changeset_digest; mismatch rejects.
      rationale: |

        Advisory narratives from LLM reviewers are recorded but never substitute for
        terminal-verifier evidence in admission decisions.
      rationale: |
        LLM outputs can be manipulated or hallucinated. Terminal verifiers (tests,
        linters, security scanners) provide ground truth.
      enforcement: Admission policy requires terminal-verifier evidence for pass.
