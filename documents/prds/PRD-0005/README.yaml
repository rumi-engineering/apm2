  title: "RFC Idea Compiler Pipeline - Codebase-Aware RFCs and Multi-Model Orchestration"
  description: |
    This PRD defines the "Idea Compiler": a deterministic compilation pipeline
    that converts an operator-provided plan/PRD into a codebase-aware RFC and a
    low-noise set of engineering tickets.

    The pipeline explicitly incorporates repository truth (crates/modules/APIs,
    AGENTS.md invariants, and prior decisions) via a generated Codebase Context
    Pack, and records model/provider provenance per stage.

  decomposition:
    - "requirements/: one file per requirement (low-context friendly)."
    - "evidence_artifacts/: one file per evidence artifact definition (low-context friendly)."
  key_outputs:
    - "Codebase Context Pack (CCP): component atlas + crate graph + hotspots + decision index."
    - "Impact Map: PRD requirement -> existing component + extension point mapping."
    - "RFC drafts: grounded in CCP; reuse-by-default; explicit justification for net-new substrate."
    - "Ticket set: atomic, low-noise, with deletion/migration plans when new surfaces are introduced."
    - "Run manifests: signed, content-addressed receipts for each compile run."
  binding:
    standards:
      - "standards/00_standards_meta.yaml#standards_meta"
      - "standards/lint/LINT_SPEC.yaml#lint_spec"
