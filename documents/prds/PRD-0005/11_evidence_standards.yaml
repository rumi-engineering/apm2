      statement: "Every PRD requirement MUST map to one or more evidence artifacts with reproducible verification commands."
    - id: EPOL-0002
      statement: "Evidence artifacts MUST declare data classification and redaction guidance; RESTRICTED evidence MUST set redaction.required=true and include redaction steps."
    - id: EPOL-0003
      statement: "All evidence verification commands MUST declare network_access; default is DISALLOWED."
