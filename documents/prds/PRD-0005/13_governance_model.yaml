    concepts:
      authority: "Roles/capabilities that can approve gates, adjudications, and waivers."

      responsibility: "Domains accountable for correctness of specific surfaces."
      stewardship: "Standards governance (schemas, lint, evolution)."
    operating_principles:
      - "Mechanism-first: require gates only when the system can produce the required evidence without blocking throughput."
      - "Fail-closed on existential invariants (determinism, traceability, path existence)."
      - "Warn/observe on advisory lints until maturity thresholds are met."

      description: |
        Any requirement that cannot be mapped to an existing component via the Impact Map is classified as net-new substrate.
        Net-new substrate requires an adjudication record in the run manifest (or a dedicated adjudication document) approved by AUTH_ARCHITECTURE.
