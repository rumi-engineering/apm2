  title: Continuous Refactor Radar stage
  statement: |
    The compiler MUST provide a Refactor Radar stage that continuously emits maintenance recommendations based on CCP signals.
    Radar outputs MUST be bounded and must prioritize measurable simplification (deletion, surface area reduction, dependency cycle removal).
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Radar emits a deterministic report artifact for a configurable time window (e.g., 7d)."
    - "Radar output volume is bounded (max items) and includes prioritization rationale; hotspot signals are aggregated rather than per-file noise."
    - "Radar can emit a bounded set of maintenance tickets or a maintenance RFC proposal, with explicit measurable outcomes."
    - "Radar computes stable recurrence signatures for comparable diffs across time windows."
