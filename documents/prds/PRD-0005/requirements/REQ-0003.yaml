  title: Requirement-to-component impact mapping
  statement: |
    The compiler MUST map each PRD requirement to one or more existing codebase components and extension points identified in the CCP, producing a deterministic Impact Map artifact used by RFC framing.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "For each requirement, the Impact Map lists candidate components (stable IDs), a selected extension point, and rationale bound to atlas entries."
    - "Requirements that cannot be mapped are explicitly classified as net-new substrate and require an adjudication record before RFC emission."
    - "Impact Map is deterministic for a fixed PRD and repo state and includes stable ordering for diff-friendly review."
    - "Impact Map includes a 'duplication risk' field when multiple plausible extension points exist."
