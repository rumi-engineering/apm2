  title: Skill system integration for operator and agent workflows
  statement: |
    The system MUST integrate the compiler pipeline into the skill library so that a human operator can relay a conversation summary and an agent can execute the full PRD->RFC->ticket workflow deterministically. This includes creating a new idea-compiler skill and updating existing skills (create-rfc, prd-review) to require CCP and Impact Map inputs for RFC creation.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "A new skill `documents/skills/idea-compiler/SKILL.md` exists with invocations mapping to CLI commands and artifact inputs/outputs."
    - "The create-rfc skill is updated to require a CCP reference and Impact Map reference before drafting RFC files."
    - "Skill instructions include deterministic runbook steps and disallow manual, divergent workflows."
