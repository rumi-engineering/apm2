  title: RFC and ticket lint extensions to prevent clutter
  statement: |
    The system MUST extend linting for RFCs and tickets to prevent clutter and accidental duplication.
    The lint extensions MUST implement:
      (a) no-new-module without explicit justification,
      (b) a cousin abstraction detector that emits a duplication-risk finding,
      (c) a deletion/migration plan requirement when new surfaces are introduced.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "If a ticket creates a new module or crate, the RFC MUST include a justification entry referencing considered extension points; otherwise lint fails."
    - "The cousin abstraction detector emits a structured duplication-risk finding when heuristic similarity triggers; the RFC must explicitly acknowledge and resolve the risk."
    - "If a new abstraction is introduced, the ticket set MUST include at least one deletion/migration ticket or an explicit rationale for why deletion is not applicable."
    - "Lint rules are maturity-aware: advisory lints can be warning-first; existential invariants are fail-closed."
