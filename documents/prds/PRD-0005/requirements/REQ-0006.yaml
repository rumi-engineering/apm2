  title: Atomic ticket decomposition with migration and verification
  statement: |
    The compiler MUST emit atomic engineering tickets from RFCs. Tickets MUST be low-noise and implementation-ready, including file-level guidance, explicit dependencies, verification commands, and migration/deletion plans where required.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Each emitted ticket has a stable ticket ID and references its source RFC and requirement IDs."
    - "Each ticket includes files_to_modify, files_to_create (if any), and verification commands."
    - "Each ticket includes acceptance criteria with objective, scriptable verification steps."
    - "Tickets that introduce new surfaces include migration/deletion steps or an explicit no-deletion rationale."
