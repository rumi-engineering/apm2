      name: Engineering Agents
      description: |
        Autonomous agents executing work items (implementation, review, testing) that
        require controlled access to tools, credentials, and context. These agents
        operate within bounded episodes and must not have ambient authority.
      pain_points:
        - "Currently can bypass control plane via direct xtask invocation"
        - "No mechanical enforcement of capability boundaries"
        - "Credentials potentially accessible during execution"
      desired_outcomes:
        - "Clear capability boundaries enforced mechanically"
        - "Zero ambient credential access"
        - "Predictable tool mediation with audit trail"

      name: Human Operators (Developers)
      description: |
        Developers running local tests, debugging workflows, and iterating on
        implementation. Use CLI to interact with daemon for work orchestration.
      pain_points:
        - "xtask commands bypass security controls"
        - "Unclear what capabilities are granted during execution"
        - "No visibility into control plane decisions"
      desired_outcomes:
        - "Clear CLI interface for daemon-mediated operations"
        - "Transparency into capability grants and denials"
        - "Consistent behavior between local and CI execution"

      name: Human Operators (SREs/Security)
      description: |
        Operations and security personnel monitoring daemon health, auditing
        control plane decisions, and responding to security incidents.
      pain_points:
        - "Limited visibility into agent capability grants"
        - "No centralized enforcement point for security policy"
        - "Difficult to audit tool access patterns"
      desired_outcomes:
        - "Centralized daemon metrics for health monitoring"
        - "Complete audit trail of capability grants and denials"
        - "Clear security boundary at daemon IPC layer"
