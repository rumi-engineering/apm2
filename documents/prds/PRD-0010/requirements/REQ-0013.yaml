  statement: |
    apm2-daemon restart MUST NOT orphan running episodes; sessions MUST receive
    LEASE_REVOKED signal within 5s of daemon recovery; SessionTerminated events
    MUST be recorded in ledger.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Sessions receive LEASE_REVOKED signal within 5s of daemon recovery. Verified by: Integration test measures signal delivery timing."
    - "SessionTerminated events with rationale=DAEMON_RESTART recorded in ledger. Verified by: Ledger query after recovery shows termination events."
    - "No orphaned processes continue operating after daemon restart. Verified by: Process monitoring confirms all sessions terminated."
    - "Daemon state rebuilt from ledger replay on restart. Verified by: State inspection shows consistency with ledger."
