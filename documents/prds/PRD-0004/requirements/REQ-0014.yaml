  title: Countermeasure effectiveness tracking
  statement: 'The system MUST track countermeasure effectiveness by measuring recurrence rate before and after deployment. This proves that countermeasures actually reduce recurrence and enables learning about which remediation strategies work.'
  acceptance_criteria:
    - RecurrenceReducer maintains pre-deployment and post-deployment recurrence rates per signature.
    - Effectiveness is computed as percentage reduction in recurrence rate.
    - CountermeasureShipped event records deployment timestamp and evidence bundle.
    - 'Stats command shows effectiveness: `apm2 stats countermeasures --effectiveness`.'
    - Countermeasures with low effectiveness (<50% reduction) are flagged for review.
    - Effectiveness data is queryable for trend analysis and improvement planning.
