  title: Signed operator override commands with authority verification
  statement: Operator override commands MUST be cryptographically signed by an authorized
    operator identity using Ed25519 signatures and require explicit operator authority
    verification before execution; overrides bypass normal workflow constraints and
    thus demand the highest signing and audit standards.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - OperatorOverride events include operator_actor_id, operator_signature, and
    override_justification fields.
  - Signatures are Ed25519 over canonical protobuf-encoded event bytes with domain
    separator "OPERATOR_OVERRIDE:".
  - Signature verification is mandatory; unsigned or invalid-signature override
    commands are rejected with reason code INVALID_SIGNATURE.
  - The operator_actor_id MUST hold OPERATOR_OVERRIDE authority for the affected
    scope in the governance profile; authority verification occurs before execution.
  - Override scope, affected_work_ids, bypassed_constraints, and override_justification
    are covered by the signature and immutably recorded.
  - Multi-party override approval MAY be required based on override_risk_level;
    high-risk overrides require N-of-M signatures per INV-0007 quorum rules.
  - Override commands take effect only after successful ledger append with valid
    signature(s); the system never honors unrecorded override requests.
  - Post-override reconciliation events MUST reference the original override event
    hash, creating an audit trail.
  - Audit log records all override attempts including rejections with full attribution
    and justification.

    notes:
    - "Operator overrides are the highest-privilege operation; multi-party signing for high-risk"
    - "Override justification is mandatory and covered by signature for non-repudiation"
