  title: Signed GateRunCompleted events
  statement: GateRunCompleted events MUST be cryptographically signed by the gate
    executor identity using Ed25519 signatures; the signature binds the verdict,
    evidence references, and execution metadata to the executor's attestation.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - GateRunCompleted events include gate_executor_actor_id and executor_signature fields.
  - Signatures are Ed25519 over canonical protobuf-encoded event bytes with domain
    separator "GATE_RUN_COMPLETED:".
  - Signature verification is mandatory on event ingestion; unsigned or invalid-signature
    events are rejected with reason code INVALID_SIGNATURE.
  - The executor_actor_id MUST match an authorized gate executor for the work scope;
    mismatch causes rejection with reason code UNAUTHORIZED_EXECUTOR.
  - Gate verdicts (PASS, FAIL, NEEDS_INPUT) are only considered binding when accompanied
    by a valid executor signature.
  - Evidence artifact hashes referenced in the event are covered by the signature,
    preventing post-hoc evidence substitution.
  - Audit log records signature verification results for all GateRunCompleted events.

    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0004
