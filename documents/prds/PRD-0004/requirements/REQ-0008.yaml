  title: Gates execute as bounded holonic episodes
  statement: 'Each gate (AAT, security, code quality) MUST execute as a bounded holonic episode with defined budget constraints. Gates implement the Gate trait and are invoked by GateRunner. Episode execution respects token, time, and max_episode limits.'
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Gate trait defines gate_type(), required_evidence_categories(), and run() method.
    - GateRunner orchestrates gate execution with budget enforcement.
    - Each gate run creates EpisodeContext with work_id, lease_id, and budget limits.
    - Gate execution terminates gracefully when budget exhausted (not hard-kill).
    - GateRunStarted event emitted at start; GateRunCompleted at end.
    - Multiple gates can run in parallel if independent.
