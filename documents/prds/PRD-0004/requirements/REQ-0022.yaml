  title: MergeReceipt
  statement: Merge acceptance MUST produce a MergeReceipt event.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - MergeReceipt binds the Plan-of-Record digest to the accepted change.
  - MergeReceipt binds the ChangeSet digest representing the merged code delta.
  - MergeReceipt binds all GateRun digests that were satisfied for merge approval.
  - MergeReceipt binds all approval Decision digests from the quorum.
  - MergeReceipt binds the output repository state digest (post-merge commit hash).
  - MergeReceipt replaces 'the PR merged' as the canonical acceptance fact; downstream
    systems rely on MergeReceipt events, not VCS merge status.
  evidence:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0009
    inherited_from_prd: false
    notes:
    - Per doctrine, MergeReceipt replaces 'the PR merged' as the canonical acceptance
      fact.
    - EVID-0009 verifies MergeReceipt event structure and digest bindings.
