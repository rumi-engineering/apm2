  title: Question Lifecycle
  statement: System MUST support typed Question objects with lifecycle.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Question objects support OPEN, ANSWERED, and VERIFIED states.
  - Question objects support a BLOCKING flag that indicates the question blocks plan
    progress.
  - QuestionAsked event is emitted when a Question is created with OPEN state.
  - QuestionAnswered event is emitted when a Question transitions to ANSWERED state.
  - BLOCKING questions in OPEN state prevent plan completion predicate from returning
    true.
  - Question state transitions are recorded in the ledger and are deterministically
    replayable.
  evidence:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0010
    inherited_from_prd: false
    notes:
    - BLOCKING questions are referenced in plan completion logic.
    - EVID-0010 verifies Question lifecycle state transitions and BLOCKING behavior.
