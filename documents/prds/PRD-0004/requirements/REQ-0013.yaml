  title: Signed CountermeasureProposed events
  statement: CountermeasureProposed events MUST be cryptographically signed by the
    proposing agent identity using Ed25519 signatures; the signature binds the
    countermeasure specification, risk assessment, and affected scope to the
    proposer's attestation.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - CountermeasureProposed events include proposer_actor_id and proposer_signature fields.
  - Signatures are Ed25519 over canonical protobuf-encoded event bytes with domain
    separator "COUNTERMEASURE_PROPOSED:".
  - Signature verification is mandatory on event ingestion; unsigned or invalid-signature
    events are rejected with reason code INVALID_SIGNATURE.
  - The proposer_actor_id MUST be a member of the authorized proposer set for the
    risk domain; unauthorized proposals are rejected with reason code UNAUTHORIZED_PROPOSER.
  - Countermeasure content including remediation_steps, affected_work_ids, and
    risk_severity are covered by the signature, preventing tampering.
  - Countermeasure acceptance requires separate signed approval event per REQ-0004
    quorum rules before execution.
  - Audit log records signature verification results and proposer attribution for
    all CountermeasureProposed events.

    notes:
    - "Countermeasure proposals are security-critical; signing ensures non-repudiation"
    - "Acceptance requires separate approval workflow per governance model"
