  title: GitHub sync adapter projects ledger state
  statement: 'The GitHub sync adapter MUST project internal ledger state to GitHub PRs and issues. The adapter reads from ledger projections and writes to GitHub; it never reads GitHub as the source of truth for work state.'
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Adapter syncs Plan state to GitHub issues (or designated tracking mechanism).
    - Adapter syncs ChangeSet state to GitHub PRs (status, labels, comments).
    - Adapter syncs gate outcomes to PR checks or status.
    - Sync direction is always ledger → GitHub, never GitHub → ledger for work state.
    - Sync failures are logged but do not block internal work progression.
    - Adapter is idempotent; re-running sync produces same GitHub state.
