  title: ChangeSet reviews produce typed findings
  statement: 'Reviews of ChangeSets MUST produce typed Finding objects, not prose comments. Each Finding has a deterministic signature enabling clustering, a category, severity, location pointers, and remediation requirements.'
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Review gate outputs are Finding objects with structured fields (id, signature, category, severity, location, remediation).
    - No prose comments in review output; all feedback is typed and machine-parseable.
    - Findings are emitted as FindingReported events to the ledger.
    - Agent can programmatically parse findings and plan remediation without human interpretation.
    - Finding location includes file path, line range, and yaml_path where applicable.
