  title: AAT gate with falsifiable hypotheses
  statement: 'The AAT (Agent Acceptance Testing) gate MUST produce falsifiable hypotheses before execution and capture evidence that proves or disproves each hypothesis. Anti-gaming checks MUST verify that tests actually exercise the claimed behavior.'
  acceptance_criteria:
    - AAT gate generates hypotheses from changeset description and affected code paths.
    - Each hypothesis is a testable predicate with clear pass/fail criteria.
    - Evidence bundle includes test execution logs, coverage data, and anti-gaming check results.
    - Anti-gaming checks verify tests are not trivially satisfied (e.g., empty assertions).
    - Hypothesis failure produces a typed Finding with remediation guidance.
    - AAT evidence is sufficient for independent reviewer to verify claims.
