  title: Signed and recorded operator freeze commands
  statement: Operator freeze commands MUST be cryptographically signed by an authorized
    operator identity using Ed25519 signatures and recorded in the ledger with full
    attribution before taking effect; the signature binds the freeze scope, reason,
    and duration to the operator's authority.
  acceptance_criteria:
  - OperatorFreeze events include operator_actor_id, operator_signature, and
    authority_delegation_chain fields.
  - Signatures are Ed25519 over canonical protobuf-encoded event bytes with domain
    separator "OPERATOR_FREEZE:".
  - Signature verification is mandatory; unsigned or invalid-signature freeze commands
    are rejected with reason code INVALID_SIGNATURE.
  - The operator_actor_id MUST hold OPERATOR_FREEZE authority in the governance
    profile; unauthorized freeze attempts are rejected with reason code UNAUTHORIZED_OPERATOR.
  - Freeze scope (work_ids, actor_ids, or scope_pattern) and freeze_reason are covered
    by the signature and immutably recorded.
  - Freeze commands take effect only after successful ledger append with valid signature;
    the system never honors unrecorded freeze requests.
  - Freeze duration and auto-unfreeze conditions are specified in the signed payload.
  - Audit log records all freeze command attempts including rejections with full attribution.

    - "Operator freeze is a critical safety mechanism; signing ensures accountability"
    - "Authority delegation chain enables tracing freeze authority to root"
