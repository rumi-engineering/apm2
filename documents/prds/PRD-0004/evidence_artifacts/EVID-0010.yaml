      guidance:
      - Tests must verify Question objects support OPEN, ANSWERED, and VERIFIED states.
      - Tests must verify BLOCKING flag functionality.
      - Tests must verify QuestionAsked event emission when Question is created.
      - Tests must verify QuestionAnswered event emission on state transition.
      - Tests must verify BLOCKING questions prevent plan completion.
      - Tests must verify deterministic replay of Question state transitions.
