      guidance:
      - Tests must verify corpus replay on representative sample before acceptance.
      - Tests must verify countermeasure prevents target FindingSignature.
      - Tests must verify no new BLOCKING findings are introduced.
      - Tests must verify rollback plan validation.
      - Tests must verify canary validation period enforcement.
      - Tests must verify policy engine governance for high-impact guardrail changes.
