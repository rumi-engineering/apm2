  context:
    background: |
      Pull requests are the primary mechanism for introducing changes to the codebase.
      Traditional human-driven User Acceptance Testing (UAT) does not scale for
      high-velocity agent-assisted development. Without automated acceptance testing,
      PRs may merge with untested claims, gaming vulnerabilities, or missing evidence.

    current_state: |
      Currently, PR acceptance relies on:
      - Human code review (subjective, time-consuming, inconsistent)
      - CI unit/integration tests (necessary but not sufficient for acceptance)
      - Manual testing by authors (often undocumented, not reproducible)

      This leaves gaps:
      - No verification that PR descriptions match actual behavior
      - No detection of hardcoded values that pass tests but fail in production
      - No structured evidence that claims are verified
      - No agent-consumable acceptance criteria format

    why_now: |
      As agent-assisted development scales, we need agent-consumable quality gates.
      The autonomous factory loop requires machine-verifiable acceptance criteria.
      Human bottlenecks in review cycles slow delivery velocity.
      Evidence-based verification is required for audit and compliance.

  problem_statement:
    primary: |
      PRs merge without agent-verifiable acceptance testing, allowing untested claims,
      gaming vulnerabilities, and undocumented limitations to reach production.

    supporting_details:
      - "PR descriptions are not structured for agent consumption"
      - "No hypothesis-driven verification of claimed behavior"
      - "Hardcoded values and mock returns can pass tests without real functionality"
      - "TODOs and known limitations are not systematically documented or waived"
      - "No structured evidence bundle linking claims to verification results"
      - "No mandatory quality gate that blocks merge until acceptance testing passes"
