  type: "FUNCTIONAL"
  title: "Hypothesis-Driven Testing Protocol"
  statement: |
    The AAT agent MUST form at least 3 testable hypotheses BEFORE executing any
    verification commands. Each hypothesis MUST include a prediction, verification
    method, and be recorded with timestamp prior to execution. At least one
    hypothesis MUST test error handling or edge case behavior.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "AAT agent generates minimum 3 hypotheses per PR"
    - "Hypothesis formation timestamp precedes execution timestamp"
    - "Each hypothesis includes: ID, prediction, verification method"
    - "At least one hypothesis tests error handling or edge case"
    - "Evidence bundle includes all hypotheses with predictions and results"
    - "Hypothesis verification produces expected vs actual comparison"

    notes:
      - "Hypothesis quality is auditable through evidence bundle"
