    (verifiable predicates), Evidence Script (path and status), and Known
    Limitations (documented TODOs with waivers).

    - "PR template includes ## Expected Outcomes section with When/Then predicates"
    - "PR template includes ## Evidence Script section with path and status (NEW/MODIFIED/EXISTING)"
    - "PR template includes ## Known Limitations section for documented TODOs"
