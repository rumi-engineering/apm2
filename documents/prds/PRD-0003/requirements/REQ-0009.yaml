  type: "NON_FUNCTIONAL"
  title: "Deterministic Verification"
  statement: |
    AAT verification MUST be deterministic: given the same PR content and
    execution environment, the AAT agent MUST produce the same verdict.
    Non-determinism sources (random seeds, timestamps, network calls) MUST
    be controlled or eliminated.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "AAT agent uses fixed random seeds for any randomized operations"
    - "Timestamps are captured but not used in pass/fail logic"
    - "Network access is DISALLOWED unless explicitly permitted"
    - "Dependencies are pinned to specific versions"
    - "Re-running AAT on same commit produces same verdict"
    - "Evidence bundle includes environment snapshot for reproducibility"

    notes:
      - "Determinism is required for auditability and debugging"
