  title: "Escalation and Adjudication Protocol"
  statement: |
    When the AAT agent cannot determine pass/fail (ambiguous case), it MUST
    set status to NEEDS_ADJUDICATION and escalate to AUTH_AAT. Escalation
    follows a tiered timeout protocol with auto-fail as final fallback.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "AAT agent can identify ambiguous cases requiring human judgment"
    - "NEEDS_ADJUDICATION status triggers notification to AUTH_AAT"
    - "Level 1 escalation: 4 hour timeout to AUTH_AAT"
    - "Level 2 escalation: 24 hour timeout to AUTH_PRODUCT"
    - "Level 3 escalation: Auto-fail with documented reason"
    - "Adjudication decision recorded in evidence bundle"

    notes:
