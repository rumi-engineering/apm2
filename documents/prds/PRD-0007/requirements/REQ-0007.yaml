  title: "Measurable throughput and quality gains"
  statement: |
    The system MUST provide measurable improvements: unplanned tool calls in consumption
    mode trending toward zero, PR cycle time and defect recurrence improving after adoption,
    and AAT receipts gating critical operations with high pass rates.
  acceptance_criteria:
