  title: "Canonical context substrate (CAC-JSON)"
  statement: |
    All normative control artifacts MUST be stored as CAC-JSON, validated against
    versioned schemas with fail-closed behavior (unknown fields rejected), canonicalized
    to stable bytes prior to admission, and addressable by stable IDs and immutable
    content hashes (CAS).
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "All normative control artifacts are stored as CAC-JSON. Verified by: Schema admission rejects non-CAC-JSON normative artifacts."
    - "Artifacts validate against versioned schemas with fail-closed behavior. Verified by: Unknown fields are rejected; validation failures block admission."
    - "Canonicalization produces stable bytes deterministically. Verified by: canonicalize(canonical_bytes) == canonical_bytes for all valid inputs."
    - "Artifacts are addressable by stable IDs and content hashes. Verified by: DCP resolution returns pinned content_hash for stable_id."
