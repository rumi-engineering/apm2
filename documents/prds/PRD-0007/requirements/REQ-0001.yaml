  title: "Canonical context substrate (CAC-JSON)"
  statement: |
    All normative control artifacts MUST be stored as CAC-JSON, validated against
    versioned schemas with fail-closed behavior (unknown fields rejected), canonicalized
    to stable bytes prior to admission, and addressable by stable IDs and immutable
    content hashes (CAS).
  acceptance_criteria:
    - id: AC-0001-01
      description: All normative control artifacts are stored as CAC-JSON.
      verification_method: Schema admission rejects non-CAC-JSON normative artifacts.
    - id: AC-0001-02
      description: Artifacts validate against versioned schemas with fail-closed behavior.
      verification_method: Unknown fields are rejected; validation failures block admission.
    - id: AC-0001-03
      description: Canonicalization produces stable bytes deterministically.
      verification_method: canonicalize(canonical_bytes) == canonical_bytes for all valid inputs.
    - id: AC-0001-04
      description: Artifacts are addressable by stable IDs and content hashes.
      verification_method: DCP resolution returns pinned content_hash for stable_id.
