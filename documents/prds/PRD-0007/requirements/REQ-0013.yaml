  title: "Target delivery determinism"
  statement: |
    Target delivery rendering MUST be deterministic and constrained by target profile.
    Exports MUST be byte-identical for identical inputs. Generated files MUST embed
    provenance (stable_ids, hashes) where possible. Conformance tests MUST be required
    and their results published as evidence.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - id: AC-0013-01
      description: Export is deterministic from inputs.
      verification_method: Same source artifacts produce byte-identical export tree.
    - id: AC-0013-02
      description: Rendering follows target profile constraints.
      verification_method: Export respects rendering policy from TargetProfile.
    - id: AC-0013-03
      description: Generated files embed provenance.
      verification_method: Markdown files include provenance in YAML frontmatter.
    - id: AC-0013-04
      description: Conformance tests pass and publish evidence.
      verification_method: ExportReceipt includes conformance test report reference.
