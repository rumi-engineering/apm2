  title: "Target delivery determinism"
  statement: |
    Target delivery rendering MUST be deterministic and constrained by target profile.
    Exports MUST be byte-identical for identical inputs. Generated files MUST embed
    provenance (stable_ids, hashes) where possible. Conformance tests MUST be required
    and their results published as evidence.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Export is deterministic from inputs. Verified by: Same source artifacts produce byte-identical export tree."
    - "Rendering follows target profile constraints. Verified by: Export respects rendering policy from TargetProfile."
    - "Generated files embed provenance. Verified by: Markdown files include provenance in YAML frontmatter."
    - "Conformance tests pass and publish evidence. Verified by: ExportReceipt includes conformance test report reference."
