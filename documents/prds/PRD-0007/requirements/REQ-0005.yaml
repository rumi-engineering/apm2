  type: "FUNCTIONAL"
  title: "Target interoperability without drift"
  statement: |
    Target profiles MUST define rendering, retrieval, and delivery constraints independent
    of model intelligence. Target payloads (vendor layouts, model IRs) MUST be compiled
    deterministically from CAC sources and MUST NOT be treated as normative. Export manifests
    MUST provide provenance and be verified by conformance tests.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Target profiles define rendering, retrieval, and delivery constraints. Verified by: TargetProfile schema includes budget, rendering, and retrieval policies."
    - "Target payloads are compiled deterministically from CAC sources. Verified by: Exports from identical inputs produce byte-identical trees."
    - "Export manifests provide provenance. Verified by: ExportManifest includes source stable_ids and content hashes."
    - "Conformance tests verify exports. Verified by: Conformance test report passes for all target profiles."
