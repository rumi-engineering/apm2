# ContextPack

A pre-compiled, content-addressed, and bounded set of artifacts (files, schemas, policies, and evidence) required for a **Holon** to execute a specific task.

ContextPacks are the primary mechanism for achieving the **Zero-Tool Ideal (ZTI)**. They enforce **Markov Blanket** integrity by serving as a read-allowlist, ensuring that execution is predominantly actuation rather than discovery.
