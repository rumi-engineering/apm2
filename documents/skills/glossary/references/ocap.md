# OCAP (Object-Capability)

A security model where authority to perform an action is represented by possession of an unforgeable token or handle ("capability").

In holonic networks, **OCAP** is used to grant **Holons** sealed tool interfaces that operate strictly on the hashes provided in their **ContextPack**. This eliminates ambient authority (like broad filesystem access) and prevents "confused deputy" attacks.
