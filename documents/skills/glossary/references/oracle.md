# Oracle

A high-entropy source of truth (usually a human operator or a superior holon) used to resolve ambiguity or bridge **Specification Gaps**.

An **OracleRequest** is an explicit state transition used when a **Holon** encounters environmental complexity that exceeds its **Requisite Variety**. Unlike a **Finding**, an Oracle intervention is used to refine the upstream **Plan** or compiler rather than penalizing the implementing agent.
