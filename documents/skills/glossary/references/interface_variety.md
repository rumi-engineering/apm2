# Interface Variety

**Definition:** The measure of the complexity and range of signals allowed at a holonic boundary contract.

**Key Principle (Resolving Ashby's Paradox):**
In a holarchy, a supervisor (the "Whole") does not need to match the internal variety of its worker (the "Part"). Instead, the supervisor's internal control system must match the variety of the **Signals** and **Contracts** emitted by the worker.

By constraining the worker to a stable, typed **Active Inference Interface**, the supervisor can maintain control even if the worker's internal logic is infinitely more complex (e.g., a multi-billion parameter language model).

## Practical Application
- **Type Safety:** Typed work requests and artifacts reduce interface variety to a manageable set.
- **Protocol Envelopes:** The holon envelope filters noisy agent outputs into structured ledger events.
- **Abstraction:** Supervisors observe "TaskCompleted" or "FindingRaised" events rather than monitoring individual tokens or internal agent search loops.
