# 16 — I/O and Protocol Boundaries (Partial Progress and Untrusted Inputs)

[INVARIANT: INV-1601] Partial Progress Is the Default at I/O Boundaries.
- Reads may return fewer bytes than requested.
- Writes may write fewer bytes than provided.
- REJECT IF: code assumes "one call == full transfer" without using an API that promises it.
- ENFORCE BY: looped read/write protocols; explicit framing; use `read_exact`/`write_all` only when their semantics match the contract.
[PROVENANCE] std I/O docs: read/write semantics allow partial progress.
[VERIFICATION] Tests with artificial short reads/writes (mock streams); property tests for framing.

[CONTRACT: CTR-1601] Protocol Framing Is a First-Class Contract.
- REJECT IF: boundary formats are implicit (no length prefix, delimiter rules, versioning).
- ENFORCE BY: explicit frame format; version fields; max-size caps; deterministic encoding.
[PROVENANCE] Protocol correctness requires explicit framing; std does not impose framing.

[HAZARD: RSK-1601] Parsing Is a DoS Surface Even in Safe Rust.
- FAILURE MODE: quadratic behavior, oversized allocations, deep recursion (stack exhaustion), panic-as-DoS.
- REJECT IF: parsers allocate based on untrusted lengths without caps.
- REJECT IF: parsers use recursion without depth limits.
- ENFORCE BY: checked arithmetic; allocation caps; iterative parsing; explicit error returns.
[PROVENANCE] Rust memory safety does not prevent resource-exhaustion attacks.
[VERIFICATION] Fuzzing (mutation and structure-aware when available); property tests for size/depth bounds.

[CONTRACT: CTR-1603] Bounded Reads and Allocation Control.
- REJECT IF: any read operation (file or stream) is performed into an unbounded buffer.
- ENFORCE BY:
  - Bounded File Read: verify `metadata().len()` on the **handle** before `read_to_end`.
  - Streaming Bounded Read: use a loop with a fixed-size stack buffer and a running `total` checked against `max`.
[PROVENANCE] APM2 Implementation Standard; RSK-1601.

```rust
// Pattern: Streaming Bounded Read
pub fn read_stream_bounded<R: io::Read>(mut r: R, out: &mut Vec<u8>, max: usize) -> Result<(), Error> {
    out.clear();
    out.reserve(std::cmp::min(max, 64 * 1024));
    let mut buf = [0u8; 8192];
    let mut total = 0;
    loop {
        let n = r.read(&mut buf)?;
        if n == 0 { break; }
        total = total.saturating_add(n);
        if total > max { return Err(Error::TooLarge); }
        out.extend_from_slice(&buf[..n]);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

[CONTRACT: CTR-1602] Serialization Formats Must Be Versioned and Endianness-Specified.
- REJECT IF: a persisted/wire format depends on Rust layout (`repr(Rust)` or enum niches).
- ENFORCE BY: explicit byte-level format; endianness and alignment rules; backward compatibility tests.
[PROVENANCE] Rust Reference: layout is unspecified unless constrained; persistence requires explicit format contracts.
[VERIFICATION] Golden test vectors; backward/forward compatibility tests across versions.

[CONTRACT: CTR-1604] Strict Serde for Audit and Ledger Types.
- REJECT IF: types parsed from untrusted input lack strict parsing rules.
- ENFORCE BY:
  - `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` for all boundary objects.
  - avoid `serde(untagged)` and `flatten` on untrusted objects (ambiguity risk).
  - avoid permissive enums at boundaries; use explicit tagging.
[PROVENANCE] APM2 Security Policy; CTR-SERDE001.

[CONTRACT: CTR-1605] Deterministic Canonicalization and Signing.
- REJECT IF: canonicalization is non-deterministic or depends on platform-specific layout.
- ENFORCE BY:
  - perform canonicalization **before** signing/hashing.
  - ensure repeated fields are sorted by a stable key (lexicographic for strings/bytes).
  - verify verification uses the EXACT canonical bytes used for signing.
  - avoid floating-point normalization or multiple semantic encodings.
[PROVENANCE] AD-VERIFY-001; CTR-2612.

[CONTRACT: CTR-1606] Replay and Downgrade Protection.
- REJECT IF: security-relevant messages lack a monotonic sequence, nonce, or lease window.
- REJECT IF: version negotiation allows silent downgrade to weaker protocol versions.
- ENFORCE BY:
  - strictly increasing cursors/sequence numbers.
  - non-reusable nonces for sensitive commands.
  - explicit minimum supported version policy.
[PROVENANCE] documents/security/THREAT_MODEL.cac.json; INV-2615.

[CONTRACT: CTR-1607] Ledger and Persistence Integrity.
- REJECT IF: ledger writes can rewrite history or events are non-deterministically ordered.
- REJECT IF: crash recovery "best-effort continues" on integrity failure in SCP.
- ENFORCE BY:
  - append-only write patterns (temp -> fsync -> rename).
  - fail-stop on corruption detect.
  - newline injection guards for log-based persistence.
[PROVENANCE] APM2 Security Policy; CTR-2607.
