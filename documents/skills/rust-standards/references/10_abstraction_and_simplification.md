## State: Ideal API Analysis

```yaml
procedure:
  1. identify_cleanest_contract:
     - "What is the minimal public surface for requirements?"
  2. compare_to_pr:
     - delta: actual_api - ideal_api

assertions:
  - id: ABS-POLICY-001
    predicate: "NOT introduces_policy_where_mechanism_expected"
    on_fail:
      EMIT Finding:
        id: ABS-POLICY-001
        severity: MAJOR
        remediation:
          type: CODE
          specification: "Extract policy into configurable parameter"

  - id: ABS-LEAK-001
    predicate: "NOT leaks_internal_repr_to_public_api"
    on_fail:

## State: Abstraction Smell Detection

```yaml
smell_patterns:
  - id: SMELL-DUP
    pattern: "duplicated_logic_across_callsites"
    severity: MAJOR
    description: |
      Non-trivial functionality implemented in more than one location with
      substantively identical logic. Applies to: structured output emission,
      error formatting, state computation, file I/O patterns, CLI arg
      resolution, projection rendering, serialization protocols, validation
      logic, and any operation with behavioral semantics that could diverge.
      Copy-paste of non-trivial logic creates drift risk: one copy gets
      fixed or extended while others silently diverge. This is MAJOR, not
      a nit — behavioral divergence between copies is a latent defect.
    exclusions: |
      Trivial duplication is excluded: repeated one-liners, simple field
      access, boilerplate derives, or cases where extraction would create
      a helper with no reuse beyond the two sites and no behavioral
      semantics that could independently diverge.
    remediation: "Extract shared logic into helper function or module"

  - id: SMELL-FLAG
    pattern: "temporary_flags_unclear_lifecycle"
    severity: MAJOR
    remediation: "Document flag lifecycle or remove"

  - id: SMELL-ADHOC
    pattern: "special_case_for_single_caller"
    severity: MAJOR
    remediation: "Generalize or document exception"

  - id: SMELL-MIX
    pattern: "mixed_concerns"
    examples:
      - "allocation + logging"
      - "state_transition + io"
      - "parsing + policy"
    severity: MAJOR
    remediation: "Separate concerns into distinct modules"

  - id: SMELL-STRING
    pattern: "stringly_typed_contracts"
    severity: MAJOR
    remediation: "Replace with newtype or enum"

## State: Maintainability Review
