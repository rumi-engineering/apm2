# Transcendental Reasoning (Conditions of Possibility)

**Category:** Meta-Level and Reflective Modes

## What it is

Start from an accepted fact and infer what must be true for it to be possible (Kantian style).

## What it outputs

- Necessary preconditions
- Architectural "must-haves"
- Foundational requirements
- Presupposition analysis

## How it differs

Not empirical induction; reasons from possibility to enabling conditions. If X is possible/actual, what must be true for that to be the case?

## Best for

- Deep framework design
- Conceptual audits
- First-principles constraints
- Foundation architecture
- Philosophical analysis

## Common failure mode

Mistaking "necessary for my model" as "necessary in reality." Your framework's requirements may not be reality's requirements.
