# Narrative Reasoning / Causal Storytelling

**Category:** Dialectical, Rhetorical, and Interpretive Reasoning

## What it is

Build coherent time-ordered explanations connecting events, motives, causes into a story supporting prediction and action.

## What it outputs

- Postmortems
- Strategy narratives
- Scenario stories
- Causal explanations

## How it differs

Integrates causal/abductive/rhetorical constraints; risk is over-coherence ("too neat"). Stories are powerful but can be too tidy.

## Best for

- Incident reports
- Executive communication
- Explaining complex causal chains
- Teaching
- Strategic communication

## Common failure mode

Narrative closure crowding out alternative hypotheses. A good story feels complete even when it's wrong.
