# Mechanistic Reasoning (How It Works Internally)

**Category:** Causal, Counterfactual, Explanatory, and Dynamic Reasoning

## What it is

Explain/predict by identifying parts and interactions.

## What it outputs

- Mechanistic explanations
- Levers for intervention
- Failure modes
- Component-level understanding

## How it differs

Stronger than correlation: gives actionable intervention points and generalizes when mechanisms hold. Understanding the mechanism lets you predict behavior in new conditions.

## Best for

- Engineering
- Debugging
- Safety analysis
- Biology/medicine
- System design

## Common failure mode

"Just-so mechanisms" that sound plausible but aren't validated. A story about how something works isn't the same as knowing how it works.
