# Qualitative Reasoning (Signs, Monotone Influences, Qualitative Physics)

**Category:** Reasoning Under Vagueness

## What it is

Reason with qualitative states ("increasing," "decreasing," "positive influence") instead of exact numbers.

## What it outputs

- Directional predictions
- Qualitative constraints
- Sanity checks
- Influence diagrams

## How it differs

Not primarily uncertainty; it's coarse modeling for robustness and early design. When you don't have numbers, you can still reason about directions.

## Best for

- Early architecture
- Feedback reasoning
- "Does this trend make sense?" checks
- System dynamics without quantification

## Common failure mode

Missing nonlinear thresholds where sign reasoning breaks down. "More X means more Y" may be true only within a range.
