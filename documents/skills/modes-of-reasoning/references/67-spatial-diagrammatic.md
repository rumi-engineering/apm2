# Spatial and Diagrammatic Reasoning

**Category:** Modal, Temporal, Spatial, and Normative Reasoning

## What it is

Reason using geometry/topology and often diagrams (containment, adjacency, flows).

## What it outputs

- Spatial inferences
- Layouts
- Flow arguments
- Topological conclusions

## How it differs

Uses representational affordances of diagrams; can be more direct than symbolic propositions. Sometimes a picture really is worth a thousand words.

## Best for

- Architecture diagrams
- Supply chains
- UX
- Robotics
- Network topology

## Common failure mode

Diagram ≠ truth; pictures can hide missing constraints. A clean diagram can obscure messy reality.
