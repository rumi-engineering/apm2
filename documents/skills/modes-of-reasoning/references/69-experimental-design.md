# Experimental Design Reasoning

**Category:** Domain-Specific Reasoning Styles

## What it is

Choose interventions, measurements, and sampling to identify effects (randomization, controls, blocking, instrumentation).

## What it outputs

- Experiment plans
- Power analyses
- Measurement strategies
- Control designs

## How it differs

It's reasoning about *how to learn reliably*, not just how to analyze after the fact. The design determines what conclusions are possible.

## Best for

- A/B testing
- Causal learning
- Evaluation of interventions
- Clinical trials
- Product experiments

## Common failure mode

Measuring proxies that don't capture the real outcome (Goodhart risk). If your metric doesn't measure what you care about, your experiment doesn't tell you what you need to know.
