# Statistical Reasoning (Frequentist Style)

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

Inference about populations from samples via estimators, confidence intervals, tests, error rates.

## What it outputs

- Effect estimates + uncertainty statements tied to sampling procedures
- Confidence intervals
- P-values and test results
- Error rate guarantees

## How it differs

Typically avoids "probability of hypotheses"; emphasizes long-run properties of procedures. Focuses on what would happen if you repeated the sampling process many times.

## Best for

- Experiments
- A/B tests
- QA
- Inference under repeated-sampling assumptions
- Clinical trials

## Common failure mode

P-value worship; confusing "no evidence" with "evidence of no effect." Statistical significance is not the same as practical significance.
