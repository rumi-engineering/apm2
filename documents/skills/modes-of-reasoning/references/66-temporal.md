# Temporal Reasoning

**Category:** Modal, Temporal, Spatial, and Normative Reasoning

## What it is

Reason about ordering, duration, persistence, and change over time.

## What it outputs

- Temporal constraints
- Timelines
- Persistence assumptions
- Change detection

## How it differs

Truth depends on time; persistence defaults introduce non-monotonicity. What was true yesterday may not be true today.

## Best for

- Scheduling
- Planning
- Forensics
- Narrative validity
- State management

## Common failure mode

Hidden assumptions about persistence ("it stays true unless…"). Things change, and we often assume they don't.
