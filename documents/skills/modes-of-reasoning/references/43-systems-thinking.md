# Systems Thinking (Feedback Loops, Delays, Emergence)

**Category:** Causal, Counterfactual, Explanatory, and Dynamic Reasoning

## What it is

Reason about interacting components over time: reinforcing/balancing loops, delays, unintended consequences.

## What it outputs

- Causal loop diagrams
- Leverage points
- Dynamic hypotheses
- Emergent behavior predictions

## How it differs

Explicitly multi-level and dynamic; "local linear" reasoning often fails. Effects can be delayed, nonlinear, and counterintuitive.

## Best for

- Org design
- Markets
- Reliability engineering
- Platform ecosystems
- Long-term planning

## Common failure mode

Vague loop stories without measurable hypotheses. Drawing feedback loops is easy; validating them is hard.
