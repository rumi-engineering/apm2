# Fuzzy Reasoning / Fuzzy Logic (Vagueness)

**Category:** Reasoning Under Vagueness

## What it is

Truth is a degree (0–1) because predicates have blurred boundaries ("tall," "near," "high risk").

## What it outputs

- Degrees of membership/truth
- Fuzzy rule outputs
- Graded classifications

## How it differs

Fuzzy truth ≠ probability: probability is uncertainty about crisp facts; fuzzy membership is graded applicability. "Somewhat tall" is different from "50% chance of being tall."

## Best for

- Control systems
- Scoring/rubrics
- Policies with soft thresholds
- Natural language processing

## Common failure mode

Treating fuzzy scores like calibrated probabilities. A fuzzy membership of 0.7 doesn't mean 70% probability.
