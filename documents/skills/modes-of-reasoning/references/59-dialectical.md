# Dialectical Reasoning (Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis)

**Category:** Dialectical, Rhetorical, and Interpretive Reasoning

## What it is

Advance understanding through structured opposition: surface tensions, refine concepts, integrate perspectives.

## What it outputs

- Refined positions
- Conceptual synthesis
- Clarified distinctions
- Resolved tensions

## How it differs

Unlike paraconsistency (tolerating contradictory data), dialectic uses tension to improve concepts and frames. Contradiction is productive, not just tolerable.

## Best for

- Strategy debates
- Assumptions audits
- Resolving conceptual confusion
- Philosophy
- Design critique

## Common failure mode

Endless debate without convergence criteria. Dialectic without resolution is just arguing.
