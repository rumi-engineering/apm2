# Model-Based / Simulation Reasoning

**Category:** Causal, Counterfactual, Explanatory, and Dynamic Reasoning

## What it is

Run an internal model (mental or computational) to predict consequences under scenarios.

## What it outputs

- Scenario traces
- Sensitivity analyses
- "What-if" results
- Predicted outcomes

## How it differs

Not proof-like; it's generative prediction from a specified model. Shows what would happen according to the model, not what must happen logically.

## Best for

- Complex systems
- Policy design
- Engineering dynamics
- Capacity planning
- Scenario analysis

## Common failure mode

Simulation overconfidence; unvalidated models. The simulation is only as good as the model it runs.
