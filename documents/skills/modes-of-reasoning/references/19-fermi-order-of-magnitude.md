# Fermi / Order-of-Magnitude Reasoning

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

Rough quantitative estimates via decomposition and bounding.

## What it outputs

- Back-of-the-envelope estimates
- Upper/lower bounds
- Sensitivity drivers
- Sanity checks

## How it differs

A heuristic quantitative mode: aims for **scale correctness** rather than precision. Good enough to know if something is thousands or millions, not exact numbers.

## Best for

- Early feasibility
- Sanity checks
- Identifying dominant terms
- Quick prioritization
- Interview problems

## Common failure mode

Hidden unit mistakes or implicit assumptions left untested. Errors in component estimates can compound.
