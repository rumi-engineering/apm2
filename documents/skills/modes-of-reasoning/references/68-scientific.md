# Scientific Reasoning (Hypothetico-Deductive Cycle)

**Category:** Domain-Specific Reasoning Styles

## What it is

A workflow: abduce hypotheses, deduce predictions, test (statistics), revise beliefs/theories.

## What it outputs

- Models
- Predictions
- Experiments
- Updated beliefs

## How it differs

An integrated pipeline rather than a single inference rule. Combines multiple reasoning modes in a structured workflow.

## Best for

- R&D
- Experimentation platforms
- Measurement culture
- Product development
- Academic research

## Common failure mode

Confirmation bias; underpowered experiments; publication/reporting bias. The scientific method requires discipline to execute well.
