# Modal Reasoning (Necessity/Possibility; Epistemic; Dynamic)

**Category:** Modal, Temporal, Spatial, and Normative Reasoning

## What it is

Reason with "necessarily," "possibly," "knows," and "after action α…" operators.

## What it outputs

- Claims about possibility spaces
- Knowledge attributions
- Action effect specifications
- Necessary vs contingent truths

## How it differs

Makes distinctions explicit that classical logic can't express cleanly. Distinguishes what must be true from what happens to be true.

## Best for

- Security (knowledge)
- Planning (actions)
- Reasoning about contingencies
- Specification of systems

## Common failure mode

Treating "possible" as "likely" or "knowable." Possibility and probability are different.
