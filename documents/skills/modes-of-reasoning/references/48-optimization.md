# Optimization Reasoning

**Category:** Practical Reasoning

## What it is

Choose the best solution relative to an objective subject to constraints.

## What it outputs

- Optimal/near-optimal decisions
- Tradeoff curves
- Shadow prices
- Sensitivity analysis

## How it differs

Constraint satisfaction asks "any feasible?"; optimization asks "best feasible." Goes beyond finding a solution to finding the best one.

## Best for

- Resource allocation
- Routing
- Scheduling
- Design tradeoffs
- Pricing

## Common failure mode

Optimizing the wrong objective or ignoring unmodeled constraints. Perfect optimization of the wrong thing is worse than approximate optimization of the right thing.
