# Value-of-Information Reasoning (What to Learn Next)

**Category:** Practical Reasoning

## What it is

Decide which measurements/experiments reduce uncertainty *most per cost* to improve decisions.

## What it outputs

- Experiment priorities
- Instrumentation plans
- "Next best question"
- Expected value of perfect/sample information

## How it differs

Meta-decision theory: picks information acquisition actions. Not what to decide, but what to learn before deciding.

## Best for

- R&D prioritization
- Analytics roadmaps
- Incident investigation sequencing
- Test design

## Common failure mode

Measuring what's easy, not what changes decisions. Information only has value if it would change what you do.
