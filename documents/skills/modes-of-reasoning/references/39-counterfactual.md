# Counterfactual Reasoning ("What Would Have Happened If...")

**Category:** Causal, Counterfactual, Explanatory, and Dynamic Reasoning

## What it is

Evaluate alternate histories given a causal model.

## What it outputs

- Counterfactual outcomes
- Blame/credit analyses
- Individualized explanations
- Scenario comparisons

## How it differs

Needs causal structure beyond pure statistics. You can't answer "what would have happened" just from observed data.

## Best for

- Postmortems
- Accountability
- Scenario evaluation
- Personalized decision support
- Explanation of individual cases

## Common failure mode

Confident counterfactuals from weak models. "If we had done X, Y would have happened" requires a good causal model.
