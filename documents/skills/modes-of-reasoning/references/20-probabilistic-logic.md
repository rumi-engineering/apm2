# Probabilistic Logic (Logic + Probabilities)

**Category:** Reasoning Under Uncertainty

## What it is

Blend logical structure (relations/rules/quantifiers) with probabilistic uncertainty (e.g., probabilistic programming + constraints).

## What it outputs

- Probabilistic inferences over structured worlds
- Uncertain rule consequences
- Relational predictions with uncertainty

## How it differs

More expressive than plain Bayesian models for relational domains; more uncertainty-aware than pure logic. Combines the structure of logic with the gradation of probability.

## Best for

- Knowledge graphs with uncertainty
- Uncertain policies
- Relational prediction
- Combining rules with statistical evidence

## Common failure mode

"Model soup" (too expressive → hard to validate; brittle inference). The flexibility that makes it powerful also makes it easy to overfit or create unvalidatable models.
