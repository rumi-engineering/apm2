# Clinical / Operational Troubleshooting Reasoning

**Category:** Domain-Specific Reasoning Styles

## What it is

Blend pattern recognition (cases), mechanistic models, tests, triage, and risk constraints under time pressure.

## What it outputs

- Triage decisions
- Test sequences
- Interventions with safety checks
- Diagnosis pathways

## How it differs

A real-world hybrid mode optimized for time-critical, high-stakes diagnosis. You don't have time for perfect information.

## Best for

- SRE/ops
- Support escalation
- Medical-style workflows
- Emergency response
- Production incidents

## Common failure mode

Skipping confirmatory tests; treating correlations as mechanisms. Speed is important but so is not making things worse.
