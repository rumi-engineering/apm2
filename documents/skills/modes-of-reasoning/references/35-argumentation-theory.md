# Argumentation Theory (Structured Pro/Con Evaluation)

**Category:** Reasoning with Inconsistency, Defaults, and Change

## What it is

Build arguments and counterarguments; compute which claims stand given attack/defense relations.

## What it outputs

- Accepted/warranted claims
- Rationale maps
- Structured debate representations

## How it differs

Not just "derive consequences" but "evaluate competing reasons." Models the dialectical structure of reasoning, not just logical entailment.

## Best for

- Governance
- Policy disputes
- Legal-style reasoning
- Stakeholder conflicts
- Decision justification

## Common failure mode

Mistaking "won the debate" for "is true" (argument strength vs reality). A persuasive argument isn't necessarily correct.
