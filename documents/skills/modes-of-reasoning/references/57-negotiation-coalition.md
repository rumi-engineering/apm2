# Negotiation and Coalition Reasoning

**Category:** Strategic and Social Reasoning

## What it is

Reason about acceptable agreements and coalition formation under constraints and asymmetric information.

## What it outputs

- Offers, concessions
- Coalition structures
- Pareto improvements
- Agreement zones

## How it differs

More process- and constraint-oriented than abstract equilibrium analysis; mixes game theory with norms/rhetoric. It's about reaching agreement, not just predicting outcomes.

## Best for

- Partnerships
- Sales
- Cross-team alignment
- Contract negotiation
- Alliance formation

## Common failure mode

Winning the negotiation but losing the relationship/long-term incentives. Short-term gains can destroy long-term value.
