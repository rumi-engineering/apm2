# Inductive Reasoning (Generalization)

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

Infer general patterns from observations ("observed many A are B → probably A are B").

## What it outputs

- General rules
- Trends
- Predictors
- Pattern descriptions

## How it differs

**Not truth-preserving**; new data can overturn it. Unlike deduction, the conclusion goes beyond what the premises strictly entail. This is what makes it useful for learning but also fallible.

## Best for

- Learning from experience
- Early-stage pattern discovery
- Forming priors
- Hypothesis generation from data

## Common failure mode

Overgeneralizing from small/biased samples. "Every swan I've seen is white" doesn't mean all swans are white.
