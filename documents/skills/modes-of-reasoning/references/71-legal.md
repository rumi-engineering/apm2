# Legal Reasoning

**Category:** Domain-Specific Reasoning Styles

## What it is

Apply rules to facts, interpret texts, reason from precedents; uses burdens/standards of proof and adversarial argumentation.

## What it outputs

- Legal positions
- Compliance interpretations
- Precedent-based arguments
- Risk assessments

## How it differs

Mixes deduction, analogy, rhetoric under institutional constraints. The rules of the game are formal and the stakes are real.

## Best for

- Compliance
- Governance
- Dispute resolution
- Contract interpretation
- Regulatory analysis

## Common failure mode

Treating legal compliance as sufficient for ethical legitimacy (or vice versa). Legal and ethical are related but distinct.
