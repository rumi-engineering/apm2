# Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) / Pareto Reasoning

**Category:** Practical Reasoning

## What it is

Decide with multiple objectives (cost, speed, safety, equity), often using weights, outranking, or Pareto frontiers.

## What it outputs

- Tradeoff surfaces
- Pareto-efficient sets
- Transparent scoring models
- Weighted comparisons

## How it differs

Makes tradeoffs explicit instead of collapsing them implicitly into one objective. Acknowledges that goals often conflict.

## Best for

- Strategy
- Procurement
- Roadmap planning
- Governance
- Any multi-stakeholder decision

## Common failure mode

Arbitrary weights hiding politics; false precision. The weights reflect value judgments that should be explicit.
