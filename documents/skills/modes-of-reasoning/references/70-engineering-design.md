# Engineering Design Reasoning

**Category:** Domain-Specific Reasoning Styles

## What it is

Iterate from requirements to architectures to prototypes with tradeoffs, constraints, and failure analyses.

## What it outputs

- Designs
- Specs
- Tradeoff justifications
- Test plans
- Prototypes

## How it differs

Inherently multi-objective and constraint-laden; relies on simulation, optimization, safety margins. Design is about satisfying many constraints simultaneously.

## Best for

- Product development
- Reliability
- Architecture decisions
- Systems engineering
- Hardware/software design

## Common failure mode

Premature optimization or over-engineering; ignoring maintainability. Designing for edge cases that don't matter while missing ones that do.
