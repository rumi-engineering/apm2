# Defeasible Reasoning (Tentative Conclusions + Defeat Relations)

**Category:** Reasoning with Inconsistency, Defaults, and Change

## What it is

Conclusions can be defeated by counterevidence or stronger rules; tracks priorities/strength.

## What it outputs

- Warranted conclusions given competing reasons
- Explicit defeat relations
- Priority-aware inference

## How it differs

More explicit about conflict resolution than plain defaults. You model not just what normally holds but how competing rules interact.

## Best for

- Compliance/policy
- Medical guidelines
- Conflicting requirements
- Legal reasoning

## Common failure mode

Priority schemes that encode politics rather than relevance. Whose rule wins may reflect power rather than correctness.
