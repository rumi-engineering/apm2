# Case-Based Reasoning (Exemplar Retrieval + Adaptation)

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

Retrieve similar past cases and adapt their solutions.

## What it outputs

- Proposed solution justified by precedent
- Playbook actions
- Adapted prior solutions

## How it differs

More operational than analogy: emphasizes retrieval metrics + adaptation operators + case libraries. It's a systematic approach to learning from specific experiences.

## Best for

- Law (precedent)
- Customer support
- Clinical decision support
- Ops playbooks
- Design reuse

## Common failure mode

Cargo-culting: applying precedent without checking context changes. Past solutions may not apply when circumstances differ in important ways.
