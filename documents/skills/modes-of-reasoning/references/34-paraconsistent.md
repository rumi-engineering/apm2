# Paraconsistent Reasoning (Reasoning Despite Contradictions)

**Category:** Reasoning with Inconsistency, Defaults, and Change

## What it is

Tolerate contradictions without explosion (deriving everything).

## What it outputs

- Controlled inferences from inconsistent data
- Local reasoning despite global inconsistency
- Quarantined contradictions

## How it differs

Instead of immediately repairing inconsistency, it contains it. Classical logic explodes from contradictions; paraconsistent logic doesn't.

## Best for

- Merging inconsistent sources
- Messy enterprise data
- Early incident response
- Requirements analysis with conflicts

## Common failure mode

Never resolving contradictions that actually matter for action. Tolerating inconsistency shouldn't mean ignoring it forever.
