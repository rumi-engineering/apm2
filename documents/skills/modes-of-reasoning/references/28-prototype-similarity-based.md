# Prototype / Similarity-Based Category Reasoning

**Category:** Reasoning Under Vagueness

## What it is

Categorize by similarity to prototypes/exemplars rather than strict necessary-and-sufficient definitions.

## What it outputs

- Graded category judgments
- Typicality effects
- Family resemblance classifications

## How it differs

Natural for human categories; complements fuzzy/rough by focusing on similarity geometry. Categories have typical members, not sharp boundaries.

## Best for

- UX taxonomies
- Product categorization
- Human-facing labeling
- Cognitive modeling

## Common failure mode

Hidden bias in prototypes; category drift over time. If your prototype is biased, all classifications will be biased.

- [Case-based reasoning](15-case-based.md) — uses exemplars for problem-solving
- [Analogical reasoning](14-analogical.md) — similarity for inference, not just classification
