# Sensemaking / Frame-Building Reasoning

**Category:** Dialectical, Rhetorical, and Interpretive Reasoning

## What it is

Decide "what kind of situation is this?"—build frames that organize signals, priorities, and actions under ambiguity.

## What it outputs

- Situation frames
- Working hypotheses
- Shared mental models
- Interpretive structures

## How it differs

Precedes many other modes: it selects what counts as relevant evidence and what questions to ask. You have to frame the problem before you can solve it.

## Best for

- Crisis leadership
- Early-stage strategy
- Ambiguous competitive landscapes
- Novel situations
- Problem formulation

## Common failure mode

Locking onto the wrong frame and then reasoning flawlessly inside it. Perfect reasoning in the wrong frame produces wrong answers.
