# Game-Theoretic / Strategic Reasoning

**Category:** Strategic and Social Reasoning

## What it is

Reason when outcomes depend on others' choices.

## What it outputs

- Strategies
- Incentive analyses
- Equilibrium reasoning
- Mechanism insights

## How it differs

Decision theory treats uncertainty as nature; game theory treats uncertainty as other optimizers. Other agents respond strategically, not randomly.

## Best for

- Negotiation
- Pricing competition
- Security
- Platform rules
- Market design

## Common failure mode

Assuming rationality/common knowledge where it doesn't exist. Real people don't always play Nash equilibria.
