# Explanation-Based Learning / Reasoning

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

Use an explanation of why a solution works to generalize a reusable rule/plan.

## What it outputs

- Generalized strategies with an explanatory justification
- Reusable rules derived from specific examples
- Principled generalizations

## How it differs

It generalizes like induction but is guided/validated by **deductive explanation**. The explanation constrains and justifies the generalization.

## Best for

- Turning expert solutions into SOPs
- Reducing overfitting to anecdotes
- Creating reusable patterns from specific successes
- Knowledge engineering

## Common failure mode

Explanations that are internally elegant but empirically wrong. A beautiful theory of why something worked can still be incorrect.
