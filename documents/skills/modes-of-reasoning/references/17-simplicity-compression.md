# Simplicity / Compression Reasoning (Occam, MDL)

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

Prefer hypotheses that explain data with fewer assumptions / shorter descriptions, balancing fit vs complexity.

## What it outputs

- Bias toward simpler models
- Complexity penalties
- Regularization choices
- Model selection criteria

## How it differs

It's a **selection principle** across hypotheses; often paired with abduction and statistics. Doesn't generate hypotheses but helps choose among them.

## Best for

- Model selection
- Avoiding overfitting
- Choosing parsimonious policies
- Scientific theory choice

## Common failure mode

Oversimplifying when the world is genuinely complex/nonlinear. Sometimes the simplest explanation is too simple.
