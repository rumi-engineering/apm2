# Deontic Reasoning (Obligation/Permission/Prohibition)

**Category:** Modal, Temporal, Spatial, and Normative Reasoning

## What it is

Reason about what is permitted, required, or forbidden; handle norm conflicts and exceptions.

## What it outputs

- Norm-consistent action sets
- Compliance interpretations
- Obligation/permission derivations
- Conflict resolutions

## How it differs

Normative: about "ought," not "is." Often non-monotonic due to exceptions. You can't derive what should be from what is.

## Best for

- Compliance
- Policy
- Ethics constraints in systems
- Access control
- Governance

## Common failure mode

Inconsistent norms; ignoring priority/lexical ordering of duties. When norms conflict, you need explicit resolution rules.
