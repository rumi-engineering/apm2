# Analogical Reasoning (Structure Mapping)

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

Transfer relational structure from a known domain/case to a new one (often deeper than surface similarity).

## What it outputs

- Candidate inferences
- Adapted solutions
- Conceptual models/metaphors
- Design patterns

## How it differs

Often **particular → particular** transfer; frequently seeds abduction ("maybe it works like…"). Focuses on structural correspondence, not just superficial resemblance.

## Best for

- Innovation
- Design
- Teaching
- Cross-domain problem solving
- Understanding unfamiliar systems

## Common failure mode

False analogies (shared surface traits, different causal structure). Just because two things look similar doesn't mean they work the same way.
