# Hermeneutic / Interpretive Reasoning (Meaning Under Ambiguity)

**Category:** Dialectical, Rhetorical, and Interpretive Reasoning

## What it is

Infer meaning and intent from language, documents, norms, artifacts using context and interpretive canons.

## What it outputs

- Interpretations
- Reconciled meanings
- Clarified definitions
- Contextual understanding

## How it differs

Emphasizes context and ambiguity management, not only formal entailment. Understanding what someone meant, not just what they said.

## Best for

- Contracts
- Policy docs
- Requirements
- Qualitative feedback synthesis
- Cross-cultural communication

## Common failure mode

Over-interpreting; reading intent that isn't there. Finding meaning that the author never intended.
