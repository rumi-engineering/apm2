# Decision-Theoretic Reasoning (Utilities + Uncertainty)

**Category:** Practical Reasoning

## What it is

Combine beliefs with preferences/utilities to choose actions (e.g., expected utility).

## What it outputs

- Option rankings
- Policies
- Explicit tradeoffs
- Optimal decisions under uncertainty

## How it differs

Bayesian reasoning updates beliefs; decision theory adds values and consequences. It's not just what to believe but what to do.

## Best for

- Portfolio choices
- Risk decisions
- Prioritization
- Pricing
- Any decision under uncertainty

## Common failure mode

Utility mismatch (what you optimize isn't what you truly value). Optimizing the wrong objective can be worse than not optimizing.
