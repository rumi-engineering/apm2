# Assurance-Case / Safety-Case Reasoning

**Category:** Reasoning with Inconsistency, Defaults, and Change

## What it is

Structured argument that a system is acceptably safe/secure/reliable, supported by evidence and subclaims (often tree-like).

## What it outputs

- Safety case documents
- Risk arguments
- Evidence traceability
- Claim-argument-evidence structures

## How it differs

It's argumentation constrained by standards and evidence requirements; bridges formal and empirical reasoning. Not just persuasion but structured justification.

## Best for

- Safety-critical systems
- Compliance audits
- AI governance documentation
- Regulatory submissions

## Common failure mode

Paper compliance (beautiful argument, weak evidence). The structure looks good but the actual evidence is thin.
