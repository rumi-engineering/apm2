# Historical / Investigative Reasoning

**Category:** Domain-Specific Reasoning Styles

## What it is

Reconstruct what happened from incomplete sources; triangulate evidence; assess credibility; compare hypotheses.

## What it outputs

- Best-available reconstructions
- Source assessments
- Confidence statements
- Evidence chains

## How it differs

Strong emphasis on provenance, bias, and alternative explanations under uncertainty. Every source has a perspective; every reconstruction is tentative.

## Best for

- Audits
- Incident reconstruction
- Due diligence
- Fraud investigations
- Postmortems

## Common failure mode

Overfitting to a compelling narrative; neglecting disconfirming evidence. The story that fits best may not be true.
