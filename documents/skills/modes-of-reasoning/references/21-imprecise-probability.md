# Imprecise Probability / Interval Probability

**Category:** Reasoning Under Uncertainty

## What it is

Represent uncertainty with **ranges** of probabilities when precision isn't justified.

## What it outputs

- Bounds on beliefs and decisions
- Sensitivity analyses
- Robust conclusions under uncertainty about uncertainty

## How it differs

Less committal than a single prior/posterior; separates "unknown" from "unlikely." Acknowledges that sometimes we don't know enough to assign precise probabilities.

## Best for

- High-stakes decisions with weak priors
- Governance/risk
- Robustness checks
- Situations with deep uncertainty

## Common failure mode

Paralysis ("ranges are wide, so we can't decide")—needs decision rules. Having interval probabilities doesn't mean you can avoid making decisions.
