# Rhetorical Reasoning (Persuasion-Oriented)

**Category:** Dialectical, Rhetorical, and Interpretive Reasoning

## What it is

Reasoning aimed at belief-change and coordination, considering audience, framing, ethos/pathos/logos.

## What it outputs

- Persuasive arguments
- Narratives
- Positioning
- Communication strategies

## How it differs

Not primarily truth-preserving; it's about adoption—ideally constrained by truth. The goal is to change minds, not just be correct.

## Best for

- Change management
- Stakeholder alignment
- External communication
- Marketing
- Policy advocacy

## Common failure mode

Manipulative persuasion that erodes trust and long-run effectiveness. Winning arguments through manipulation backfires.
