# Likelihood-Based Reasoning (Comparative Support)

**Category:** Ampliative Reasoning

## What it is

Compare how well hypotheses predict observed data via likelihoods, without necessarily committing to priors.

## What it outputs

- Likelihood ratios
- Relative evidential support rankings
- Model comparisons

## How it differs

Separates "data support" from "belief after priors"; sits between Bayesian and frequentist idioms. Focuses on what the data say about hypotheses, not on full posterior beliefs.

## Best for

- Model comparison
- Forensic evidence strength
- Hypothesis triage
- Scientific model selection

## Common failure mode

Ignoring base rates/priors entirely when they matter for decisions. Likelihood ratios alone don't tell you which hypothesis is more probable.
