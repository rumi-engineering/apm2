# Belief Revision and Belief Update (AGM-style Families)

**Category:** Reasoning with Inconsistency, Defaults, and Change

## What it is

Principles for revising an accepted belief set with new info, especially when inconsistent.

## What it outputs

- Revised belief sets with minimal-change goals
- Principled contraction/expansion operations
- Consistent knowledge states

## How it differs

Bayesian updating revises degrees; belief revision revises acceptance of propositions. It's about what you accept as true, not how confident you are.

## Best for

- Knowledge management
- Requirements evolution
- Source reconciliation
- Database updates

## Common failure mode

"Minimal change" preserves outdated core assumptions. Sometimes you need to revise foundational beliefs, not just peripheral ones.
