# Satisficing (Bounded Rationality with Stopping Rules)

**Category:** Practical Reasoning

## What it is

Seek a solution that is "good enough" given time/compute/info limits rather than globally optimal.

## What it outputs

- Thresholds
- Stopping rules
- Acceptable solutions
- Aspiration levels

## How it differs

Not "lazy optimization"; it's rational under constraints. When optimization costs exceed benefits, satisficing is the rational approach.

## Best for

- Real-time ops
- Fast-moving environments
- Early product strategy
- High-frequency decisions

## Common failure mode

Thresholds too low → chronic mediocrity; too high → disguised optimization. Finding the right "good enough" level is itself a judgment.
