# Reflective Equilibrium (Coherence Between Principles and Judgments)

**Category:** Meta-Level and Reflective Modes

## What it is

Iteratively adjust both principles and case judgments until they cohere.

## What it outputs

- Coherent principles + case decisions
- Updated policies/norms
- Justified exceptions
- Harmonized judgments

## How it differs

Not deduction from fixed axioms; principles and judgments co-evolve. Neither theory nor intuition has automatic priority.

## Best for

- Policy design
- Governance
- Value-laden decisions
- Ethics development
- Standard setting

## Common failure mode

Coherence achieved by quietly dropping hard cases. If your principles don't handle difficult cases, they may not be the right principles.
