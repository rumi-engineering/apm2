# Moral / Ethical Reasoning

**Category:** Domain-Specific Reasoning Styles

## What it is

Reason about right/wrong and value tradeoffs (consequentialist, deontological, virtue, contractualist, care ethics, etc.).

## What it outputs

- Value constraints
- Ethical justifications
- Tradeoff statements
- Normative principles

## How it differs

Normative: cannot be reduced to facts alone, though must be informed by them. You can't derive "ought" purely from "is."

## Best for

- AI governance
- Product harms
- Trust & safety
- People policy
- Organizational values

## Common failure mode

Values laundering ("it's 'ethical' because it helps our goal") without principled constraints. Dressing up preferences as ethics.
