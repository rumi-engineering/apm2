# Heuristic Reasoning (Fast Rules of Thumb)

**Category:** Practical Reasoning

## What it is

Use simple rules that often work; fast but biased.

## What it outputs

- Quick decisions/inferences
- Prioritization shortcuts
- Default actions
- Mental shortcuts

## How it differs

Less principled but cheaper; should be paired with checks/calibration. Trading accuracy for speed when speed matters.

## Best for

- Triage
- First drafts
- Guiding search
- High-frequency low-stakes decisions

## Common failure mode

Heuristics become doctrine. Rules of thumb ossify into unquestioned rules.
