# Planning / Policy Reasoning (Sequences of Actions)

**Category:** Practical Reasoning

## What it is

Compute action sequences or policies achieving goals under constraints and dynamics.

## What it outputs

- Plans
- Policies
- Contingencies
- Playbooks

## How it differs

Outputs a procedure, not a proposition. The result is something to do, not something to believe.

## Best for

- Operations
- Project plans
- Incident response
- Automation design

## Common failure mode

Plans that ignore uncertainty and execution reality. "No plan survives contact with reality."
