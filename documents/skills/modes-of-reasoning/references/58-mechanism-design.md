# Mechanism Design / Incentive Engineering

**Category:** Strategic and Social Reasoning

## What it is

Design rules so that self-interested behavior leads to desired outcomes (align incentives).

## What it outputs

- Policies
- Marketplaces
- Compensation plans
- Governance structures
- Auction designs

## How it differs

Reverse game theory: instead of predicting behavior under rules, choose rules to shape behavior. You're designing the game, not playing it.

## Best for

- Platforms
- Internal governance
- Moderation policies
- Compensation systems
- Voting systems

## Common failure mode

Goodharting (metrics become targets and get gamed). When you optimize for a proxy, people optimize against you.
