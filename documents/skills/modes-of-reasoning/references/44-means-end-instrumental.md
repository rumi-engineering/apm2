# Means-End / Instrumental Reasoning

**Category:** Practical Reasoning

## What it is

From goals, derive actions/subgoals necessary or helpful to achieve them ("to get X, do Y").

## What it outputs

- Action rationales
- Subgoals
- Dependency chains
- Instrumental requirements

## How it differs

About doing, not merely believing; feeds planning and decision theory. Connects beliefs about the world to choices about action.

## Best for

- Strategy decomposition
- OKRs
- Operational planning
- Goal-directed behavior

## Common failure mode

Local means become ends ("process is the goal"). People optimize the intermediate steps and forget the actual objective.
