            For each gate in the invariant order (1-7):
            1. Execute gate (SCHEMA -> LINT -> TRACEABILITY -> CCP-MAPPING -> QUALITY -> EVIDENCE -> CONTENT).
            2. If gate FAILS with BLOCKER/MAJOR findings:
               a. PROPOSE_EDITS: Generate remediations (BOUND_ADDED, EVIDENCE_LINKED, etc.).
               b. APPLY_EDITS: Modify PRD if substance test passes.
               c. DELTA_QUALITY_CHECK: Verify fix is not PROSE_ONLY.
               d. RE-RUN: Repeat gate check once to verify fix.
            3. Record final findings for the gate.
