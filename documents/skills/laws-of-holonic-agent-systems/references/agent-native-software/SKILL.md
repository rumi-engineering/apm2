# Agent-Native Software: Industry Textbook

This skill provides access to the core principles of agent-native software engineering, derived from first principles: finite context windows, stochastic inference, and tool-call control loops.

## Core Documents

| Document | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| [1. Mathematical Foundations](references/01_mathematical_foundations.md) | **First Principles.** Treats LLMs as stochastic transducers and context as a bandwidth-limited channel. Defines tool calls as a POMDP control problem and explores cost models for tokens and risk. |
| [2. Contracts, State, and Evidence](references/02_contracts_state_evidence.md) | **Stability & Truth.** Focuses on contracts as the primary interface between cognition and execution. Explores event sourcing, cryptographic evidence bundles, and determinism envelopes for replayability. |
| [3. Holonic Decomposition](references/03_holonic_decomposition.md) | **Scaling Complexity.** Defines holons as autonomous compositional units. Covers boundary permeability, capability-based reasoning, and the economics of parallelism in agent swarms. |
| [4. Security and Robustness](references/04_security_adversarial_robustness.md) | **Adversarial Control.** Establishes threat models for bounded-cognition actors. Details capability security, sandboxing, and governance as an adaptive control loop to manage risk. |

## Theoretical Extensions

| Document | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| [Extension Volume: Theoretical Limits](references/05_theoretical_limits.md) | **Advanced Theory.** Integrates computability theory (halting problem), Flp/CAP constraints, and computational irreducibility into a unified doctrine for hyper-advanced agent-native systems. |
