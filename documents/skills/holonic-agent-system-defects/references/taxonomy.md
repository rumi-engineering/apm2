# Defects in Holonic Agent Systems — Taxonomy: Domains, Stages, Surfaces

## 1. Domains
Use broad, stable domains: CONTEXT, ENGINEERING, VERIFICATION, SECURITY_CAPABILITY, PRODUCT_VALUE, OPERATIONS, ECONOMICS. Domains describe the nature of the failure, not its location.

## 2. Stages
Defects can be detected at any stage: INTENT, REFINEMENT, PLANNING, IMPLEMENTATION, REVIEW, CI, UAT, RELEASE, RUNTIME, INCIDENT, GOVERNANCE. Later-stage detection implies verifier escape.

## 3. Surfaces
Surfaces map to contracts: CLI, DAEMON_API, LEDGER, EVIDENCE, PRIMITIVE, TEMPLATE, DOCS, POLICY, CAPABILITY, INFRA, OBSERVABILITY, RELEASE_CHANNEL, ECONOMICS. A surface defect is a contract defect until proven otherwise.
