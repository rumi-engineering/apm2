waiver:
  id: WVR-0101
  title: "Transitional governance freshness bypass"
  description: |
    Permits transitional governance mode to bypass stop-uncertainty
    deadline denial while no authenticated governance transport is
    available. The local deterministic resolver (GovernancePolicyResolver)
    cannot provide real governance freshness evidence because it is
    in-process and always succeeds. Real governance transport arrives
    in rollout phase S1.5 (cross-cell governance channel).

    This waiver expires automatically and MUST be renewed or replaced
    by authenticated governance transport wiring.
