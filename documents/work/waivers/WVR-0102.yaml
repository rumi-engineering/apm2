waiver:
  id: WVR-0102
  title: "Deferred pre-actuation budget enforcement"
  description: |
    Permits production constructors to wire BudgetTracker::deferred()
    for pre-actuation budget checks. Pre-actuation receipts report
    budget_checked=false with budget_enforcement_deferred=true.
    The replay verifier accepts this tuple as valid in Phase 1.

    Real per-session budget limits require episode budget allocation
    (TCK-00346), which depends on authoritative budget sources not
    yet available. This waiver expires automatically and MUST be
    renewed or replaced by concrete budget tracking wiring.
