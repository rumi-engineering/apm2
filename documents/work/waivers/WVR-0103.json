    "description": "Permits authoritative handlers (IngestReviewReceipt, DelegateSublease)\nto validate identity_proof_hash as a shape-only commitment (32-byte\nnon-zero) without dereferencing from CAS or executing\nIdentityProofV1::verify() at admission time.\n\nFull CAS dereference + cryptographic verification requires CAS\ntransport integration, which is delivered by TCK-00359 (verifier\ncache contract and invalidation correctness). Until then, the hash\nacts as a binding commitment — callers attest they hold a valid\nproof by providing its hash, and the hash is bound into signed\nledger events for audit.\n\nThis waiver expires automatically and MUST be renewed or replaced\nby CAS-backed proof verification.\n",
