# WVR-0006: Temporary FAC pull_request execution on self-hosted runner
#
# SUPERSEDED: The attack vector this waiver covered (running workflow YAML from
# PR branch on self-hosted runner) has been eliminated by splitting into two
# workflows: forge-admission-barrier.yml (pull_request_target only) and
# forge-admission-cycle.yml (workflow_run + workflow_dispatch only). Both
# patterns guarantee YAML execution from the default branch.

  rationale: |
    Originally approved to temporarily permit pull_request trigger execution on
    the self-hosted FAC runner. This introduced a fork-based attack vector where
    an external contributor could modify the workflow YAML in their PR branch to
    bypass barrier checks and execute arbitrary code on the runner.

    The attack vector has been eliminated by splitting into two workflows:
    - forge-admission-barrier.yml: triggered by pull_request_target only (YAML
      always from base/default branch)
    - forge-admission-cycle.yml: triggered by workflow_run (after barrier
      completes) and workflow_dispatch (manual). workflow_run always executes
      YAML from the default branch.

    This waiver is now SUPERSEDED — no trigger trust boundary regression remains.
