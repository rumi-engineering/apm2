  title: "Required-check strictness decrease: remove ai-review/* contexts"
  description: |
    Permits removing ai-review/security and ai-review/code-quality from
    required status checks in branch protection and rulesets. These legacy
    contexts are superseded by the Review Gate Success workflow
    (review-gate.yml), which evaluates machine-readable metadata blocks in
    PR review comments via cargo xtask review-gate.

    The Review Gate Success context is written exclusively by the trusted
    base-branch evaluator workflow (.github/workflows/review-gate.yml),
    which runs in pull_request_target / issue_comment context and checks
    out base-branch code. PR-branch ai-review-*.yml workflows no longer
    write any status contexts — they only post review comment artifacts.

    GitHub is a projection surface per RFC-0018 (Forge Admission Cycle);
    it is not the sole source of truth. The operator accepts this
    strictness reduction as a simplification that removes redundant
    required checks while preserving equivalent gate strength through
    the unified Review Gate Success evaluator.
