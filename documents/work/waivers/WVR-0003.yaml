# WVR-0003: Adapter Profile Hash Policy Binding Waiver
# Time-bounded waiver allowing CAS-existence as proxy for governance binding.

  rationale: |
    The `expected_adapter_profile_hash` field in `PolicyResolution` is not yet
    populated by the governance resolution pipeline. Until governance wiring is
    complete (TCK-00415+), adapter profile hashes are accepted when they exist
    in the content-addressed store (CAS), without policy-level binding.

    Accepted risk: CAS-existence serves as the authorization check. An actor
    with write access to CAS could publish arbitrary profiles. This is mitigated
    by CAS write restrictions (only daemon can seed builtin profiles) and the
    time-bounded nature of this waiver.

    Once governance populates `expected_adapter_profile_hash`, the waiver code
    path (dispatch.rs WVR-0003 branches) will be removed and mismatches will
    be hard-rejected.

  mitigations:

    approval_notes: |
      Approved as a time-bounded rollout waiver. CAS-existence provides
      sufficient authorization for the current rollout phase. Full policy
      binding is tracked by TCK-00415.
