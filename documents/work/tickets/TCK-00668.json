This leads to:\n  - missing/duplicated comments when restarts occur,\n  - inability to reconstruct review evidence without access to the operator machine,\n  - brittle parsing and drift between \"what happened\" and \"what GitHub shows\".\n\nRFC-0032 introduces WorkContextEntry as the kernel-native artifact carrier:\n  - CAS-backed, hash-addressed, replayable.\n  - Indexable by daemon projections.\n  - Suitable for BFT-ready audit and automated implementer orchestration.\n"
