  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Add explicit boundary intent typing checks (`Observe`, `Assert`, `Delegate`, `Actuate`, `Govern`) at lifecycle admission boundaries."
      - "Enforce acceptance-fact separation so Observe-class payloads cannot satisfy authoritative predicates."
      - "Emit replay-verifiable typed lifecycle receipts linking intent class to join/revalidate/consume/effect traces."
      - "Add deny-path coverage for intent-class confusion and downgraded acceptance-fact substitutions."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Redefinition of RFC-0027 lifecycle semantics."
      - "Performance optimization of lifecycle receipt serialization."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Introduce typed intent classification contract for boundary ingress."
      - "Bind lifecycle receipts to intent class and acceptance-fact lineage."
      - "Add deterministic deny behavior for Observe-to-authority coercion attempts."
      - "Add integration tests and evidence trace extraction for lifecycle completeness."
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
      - "EVID-0001"
    criteria:
      - "Observe-class inputs cannot satisfy authoritative admission predicates."
      - "Every authoritative external interaction has replay-verifiable boundary intent type metadata."
      - "Missing or mismatched intent-type receipt fields fail closed with structured defects."
  notes:
    security: |
      Intent class confusion is treated as privilege escalation and must deny.
    verification: |
      Include positive and negative test traces showing intent typing integrity.
    general: |
      This is the prerequisite baseline ticket for all subsequent RFC-0028 implementation tickets.
