  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Extend SessionStatusResponse to include terminal state information when session has ended."
      - "Add `termination_reason` field (normal, crash, timeout, quarantined, budget_exhausted)."
      - "Add `exit_code` field for process exit status."
      - "Add `actual_tokens_consumed` field (if available from agent adapter)."

  plan:
    steps:
      - "Add `TerminationInfo` struct with fields: reason, exit_code, terminated_at_ns, actual_tokens_consumed."
      - "Add `termination_info: Option<TerminationInfo>` to session registry entry."
      - "When a session process exits, the episode runtime should call `session_registry.mark_terminated(session_id, info)`."
      - "In SessionStatus handler, when `termination_info` is `Some`, return state=TERMINATED with the termination details."
      - "Add a TTL (e.g., 5 minutes) for terminated session entries to prevent unbounded growth."
      - "Add `SessionClient::session_status_with_termination()` method that returns the extended response."
      - "Add integration test: spawn session, simulate termination, query status, verify TERMINATED state with reason."
  definition_of_done:
    criteria:
      - "SessionStatus for an active session returns state=ACTIVE (no regression)."
      - "SessionStatus for a terminated session returns state=TERMINATED with termination_reason and exit_code."
      - "Terminated session entries are preserved for at least 5 minutes after termination."
      - "SessionClient can distinguish ACTIVE from TERMINATED responses."
      - "No session entry leak -- terminated entries are cleaned up after TTL."
  notes:
    context: |
      The coordinate command (coordinate.rs lines 910-1017) currently determines
      session termination by polling heartbeat events. When the daemon rejects a
      heartbeat (session not found), the coordinate command records FAILURE because
      there is no way to distinguish a clean exit from a crash.

      The code explicitly states (line 964):
        "FAIL-CLOSED: Without an explicit success signal from the daemon, we record
         as Failure. Only a future daemon API providing a 'session completed
         successfully' status query would justify recording Success here."

      This ticket creates that "explicit success signal" by extending SessionStatus
      to return terminal state information. When the coordinate command (TCK-00386)
      queries SessionStatus and gets TERMINATED + reason=normal + exit_code=0,
      it can confidently record Success.

      The session registry currently deletes session entries when sessions end. We
      need to preserve them (with TTL) so that SessionStatus queries after
      termination still return useful information instead of "session not found".

    security: |
      Session termination info must only be readable by the session's own token
      or via the operator socket. Do not leak termination details to other sessions.
      The TTL prevents memory exhaustion from accumulated terminated entries.
