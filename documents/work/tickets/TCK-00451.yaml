        reason: "Liveness state requires stable launch identity and admission bindings."

  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Emit deterministic liveness pulse receipts for active launch executions."
      - "Implement bounded restart policy with explicit reason-coded transitions."
      - "Define and emit stable terminal reason taxonomy for launch lifecycle outcomes."
      - "Fail closed on ambiguous liveness state for authoritative progression."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Markov-blanket channel/broker bypass enforcement."
      - "Operator-facing projection commands and UI shaping."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Define liveness pulse receipt schema and emission cadence."
      - "Implement bounded restart controller with reason taxonomy."
      - "Integrate liveness verdict into authoritative gate progression checks."
      - "Add fault-injection tests for stall, crash, and ambiguous state transitions."
      - "Run required checks."

    evidence_ids:
      - "EVID-0029"
      - "EVID-0030"
    criteria:
      - "Liveness pulse receipts are emitted and consumable for active runs."
      - "Restart attempts are bounded and reason-coded."
      - "Ambiguous liveness state denies authoritative progression."
  notes:
    security: |
      Liveness uncertainty is a correctness risk and must fail closed in authority-bearing paths.
    verification: |
      Include fault-injection scenarios covering crash loops and stale liveness state.
    general: |
      This ticket defines launch lifecycle control behavior under operational failure conditions.
