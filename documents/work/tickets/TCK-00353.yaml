      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement canonical binary/text forms for PublicKeyIdV1 and KeySetIdV1
    - Enforce strict grammar and bounded length for identity key IDs
    - Publish conformance vectors and parser differential tests
    out_of_scope:
    - Cell/Holon ID derivation and certificate artifacts (TCK-00354, TCK-00355)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement canonical binary/text forms for PublicKeyIdV1 and KeySetIdV1'
    - 'Implement: Enforce strict grammar and bounded length for identity key IDs'
    - 'Implement: Publish conformance vectors and parser differential tests'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0007
    - EVID-0303
    criteria:
    - Canonical parser rejects mixed case/whitespace/non-canonical encodings
    - Binary and text identity forms round-trip losslessly
    - Cross-language conformance vectors are stable
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
