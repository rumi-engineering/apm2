        reason: "Selector closure checks build on canonical economics admission baseline."
  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Require selector/loss-profile completeness for high-risk claims."
      - "Implement deterministic replay zoom-in from hash-addressed evidence."
      - "Bind selector closure checks to RoleSpec/context-pack admission paths."
      - "Emit structured defects for unresolved selector digests or replay package gaps."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Proof-cache amortization and invalidation policy."
      - "Queue lane fairness scheduler behavior."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Introduce selector-closure completeness contract and fail-closed checks."
      - "Wire deterministic evidence zoom-in for digest-first control artifacts."
      - "Add negatives for partial selector sets and unresolved digest references."
      - "Add conformance tests and evidence extraction for replay zoom-in determinism."
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
      - "EVID-0002"
    criteria:
      - "High-risk claims deny on incomplete selector/loss-profile digests."
      - "Replay zoom-in deterministically resolves evidence by hash."
      - "Selector-closure defects emit structured deny traces."
  notes:
    security: |
      Unresolved selector state is non-admissible for promotion-critical paths.
    verification: |
      Include deterministic round-trip tests for selector closure and replay resolution.
    general: |
      This ticket implements the digest-first completeness contract required by REQ-0002.
