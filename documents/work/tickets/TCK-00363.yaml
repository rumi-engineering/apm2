      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement ReceiptPointerV1 with direct-signature or batch/FactRoot paths
    - Implement ReceiptMultiProofV1 for compact multi-receipt membership proofs
    - Update verifier and auditor tooling to accept equivalent direct vs batched semantics
    out_of_scope:
    - Hierarchy root-of-roots batching (TCK-00371)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement ReceiptPointerV1 with direct-signature or batch/FactRoot
      paths'
    - 'Implement: Implement ReceiptMultiProofV1 for compact multi-receipt membership
      proofs'
    - 'Implement: Update verifier and auditor tooling to accept equivalent direct
      vs batched semantics'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0017
    - EVID-0306
    criteria:
    - Cross-holon authoritative receipt references use ReceiptPointer by default
    - Multiproof validation yields deterministic membership results
    - Behavioral acceptance equivalence documented and tested
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
