        reason: "Compromise handling depends on temporal authority and revocation closure behavior."

        reason: "Compromise containment depends on projection isolation and worker-mediated actuation."
  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Implement projection divergence detection as observed-vs-expected digest mismatch against CAS+ledger-derived state."
      - "Quarantine compromised projection channels while preserving authoritative lifecycle progression."
      - "Require signed temporal authority references (`time_authority_ref`, `window_ref`) for compromise and quarantine decisions."
      - "Implement replay-recovery workflow to reconstruct projection state from trusted receipts after adjudication."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Generalized non-projection incident response playbooks."
      - "Cross-organization source-control recovery governance."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Add projection compromise signal and trust-snapshot chain checks."
      - "Implement quarantine state machine and authoritative-flow continuity guarantees."
      - "Bind compromise decisions to signed temporal authority envelopes and arbitration outcomes."
      - "Add reconstruction tests from durable receipts for post-containment recovery."
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
      - "EVID-0009"
    criteria:
      - "Projection divergence produces structured, digest-bound compromise evidence."
      - "Compromised projection channels are quarantined without mutating authority roots."
      - "Projection state is replay-recoverable from trusted receipts after containment."
  notes:
    security: |
      Projection compromise is non-authoritative and cannot alter CAS+ledger-rooted admission truth.
    verification: |
      Include compromise, quarantine, and recovery replay scenarios with signed temporal bindings.
    general: |
      This ticket completes RFC-0028 projection containment obligations for promotion-critical operation.
