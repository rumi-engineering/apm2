  description: |
    Create Refactor Radar that aggregates CCP signals (hotspots,
    duplication heuristics) into bounded maintenance recommendations.
    Can emit maintenance tickets or RFC proposals.

  implementation:
    files_to_create:
      - path: crates/apm2-core/src/refactor_radar/mod.rs
      - path: crates/apm2-core/src/refactor_radar/radar.rs
      - path: crates/apm2-core/src/refactor_radar/signals.rs
      - path: crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/factory/refactor.rs
    files_to_modify:
      - path: crates/apm2-core/src/lib.rs
      - path: crates/apm2-cli/src/main.rs

  verification:
    commands:
      - command: "cargo run --bin apm2 -- factory refactor radar --window 7d"
      - command: "cargo test -p apm2-core refactor_radar"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Radar output is bounded (max items)"
      - "Recommendations are actionable"
