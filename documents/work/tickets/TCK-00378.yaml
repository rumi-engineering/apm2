      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement taint lattice and confidentiality lattice propagation rules
    - Apply dual-lattice policy hooks at boundary crossings and actuators
    - Introduce DeclassificationReceipt for approved confidentiality downgrades
    out_of_scope:
    - Attestation floor tightening for high-risk tiers (TCK-00379)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement taint lattice and confidentiality lattice propagation
      rules'
    - 'Implement: Apply dual-lattice policy hooks at boundary crossings and actuators'
    - 'Implement: Introduce DeclassificationReceipt for approved confidentiality downgrades'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0032
    - EVID-0308
    criteria:
    - Tier3+ actuators reject untrusted or over-confidential inputs
    - Declassification requires explicit policy and receipt emission
    - Secret leakage adversarial tests pass
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
