      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0019 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement context delta injection between iterations (N -> N+1)
    - Cache repeated tool outputs (Search/FileRead) in CAS-backed caches when safe
    - Prefer summary receipts as iteration interfaces; zoom-in by selector only on demand
    out_of_scope:
    - Global exabyte compaction pipeline (future RFC)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep beyond out_of_scope
      list.
    - 'Implement: Implement context delta injection between iterations (N -> N+1)'
    - 'Implement: Cache repeated tool outputs (Search/FileRead) in CAS-backed caches when safe'
    - 'Implement: Prefer summary receipts as iteration interfaces; zoom-in by selector only on
      demand'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression risks per
      RFC-0019/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding EVID-*
      artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0014
    criteria:
    - Iteration N+1 default context uses deltas + summary receipts (no full history injection)
    - 20-iteration loop stays within fixed context budget envelope using deltas and summaries
  notes:
    security: Productivity-first; keep fail-closed invariants intact where already mandated by
      RFC-0019.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests and CAS/ledger replay checks; avoid relying on process
      memory.
    general: Keep changes minimal, explicit, and reversible; make dependencies and attribution
      fields queryable.
