root_cause_analysis:
  summary: |
    When a gate process is killed mid-run (e.g., worker restart, OOM, timeout),
    the lane tmp directory retains residue from the sandboxed execution
    environment. This residue includes `broker_requests` directories created
    with mode 0333 (write-only, used for sandboxed gate->broker IPC). When the
    lane cleanup path invokes `safe_rmtree_v1`, it fails with EPERM on
    `openat()` because 0333 lacks the read bit needed to enumerate directory
    contents.

    This leaves the lane in CORRUPT state with no automated recovery path.
    `apm2 fac doctor --fix` also fails at the `lane_tmp_scrub` step for the
    same reason. The only fix is manual `chmod -R u+rwX` on the lane tmp
    directory before retrying doctor or reset.

    This is a recurring issue — observed at least 3 times across two sessions
    (2026-02-22 03:xx UTC, 2026-02-22 ~17:xx UTC, 2026-02-23 ~06:38 UTC).

    Likely triggered by orchestrators running `apm2 fac gc`.

  observed_compounding_failures: |
    Two distinct corruption events were observed on lane-00 in a single session:

    1. Primary (this ticket): 0333-mode broker_requests tmp residue after worker
       crash. Lane entered CORRUPT with ~2024 stale tmp entries. The rm -rf used
       to clear was unnecessarily destructive — `chmod -R u+rwX` followed by
       `apm2 fac doctor --fix` would have sufficed per the workaround above.

    2. Secondary (separate issue, compounding): After clearing the 0333 corruption,
       lane-00's next gate run failed because its rustup home had no toolchains
       installed (~/.apm2/private/fac/lanes/lane-00/home/.rustup/toolchains/ was
       empty). The lane attempted to download nightly-2025-12-01 from
       static.rust-lang.org but failed with DNS resolution errors inside the
       sandbox (network isolation prevents downloads). Lane-01 had toolchains
       correctly provisioned; lane-00 did not. This indicates lane re-bootstrap
       after CORRUPT recovery does not re-seed the rustup toolchain directory.
       Workaround was to symlink lane-01's toolchains into lane-00.

    These are two distinct failure modes that compound: the 0333 permission bug
    prevents automated recovery, and the lack of toolchain health-checking after
    recovery leaves the lane unable to execute gates even once cleaned.
    The rustup toolchain gap is tracked as a candidate for a follow-on ticket
    (RMTREE-004 or separate TCK).

    - id: "RC-01"
      title: "Gate processes run inside systemd scopes with restricted permissions"
      detail: |
        The broker_requests IPC directories are created mode 0333 (d-wx-wx-wx)
        so sandboxed gates can write request files but not list/read them.
    - id: "RC-02"
      title: "safe_rmtree_v1 requires read bit for directory traversal"
      detail: |
        `safe_rmtree_v1` uses `openat(O_DIRECTORY)` to traverse and enumerate
        child entries before deletion. This requires the read bit on directories.
    - id: "RC-03"
      title: "openat fails on 0333 directories -> lane marked CORRUPT"
      detail: |
        When mode is 0333, `openat` returns EACCES -> safe_rmtree aborts ->
        lane cleanup fails -> lane marked CORRUPT.
    - id: "RC-04"
      title: "All files are owned by the same user — chmod u+r is sufficient"
      detail: |
        All files are owned by the same user (ubuntu:ubuntu), so `chmod u+r`
        is sufficient — no privilege escalation needed.

  reproduction: |
    1. Start a gate job that creates broker_requests dirs (any gates job)
    2. Kill the worker mid-run: `systemctl --user restart apm2-worker.service`
    3. Observe lane-00 (or whichever lane was active) enters CORRUPT state
    4. `apm2 fac doctor --fix` fails at lane_tmp_scrub with:
       "I/O error during openat directory .../broker_requests: Permission denied
       (os error 13)"
    5. Lane remains CORRUPT until manual intervention

  current_workaround: |
    chmod -R u+rwX ~/.apm2/private/fac/lanes/<lane-id>/tmp/
    apm2 fac doctor --fix

      title: "Residual hardening: keep mode-normalization fail-closed under adversarial trees"
      detail: |
        The core pre-delete normalization path now repairs user-owned directories
        via handle-relative operations and bounded traversal. Remaining work is
        hardening/verification:
          - preserve symlink refusal and ownership checks under race pressure
          - preserve Linux portability by avoiding unsupported chmod flag usage
            (`AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW`/`NoFollowSymlink`) for directory mode repair
            while still operating via an `O_NOFOLLOW|O_DIRECTORY` handle
          - keep global directory-scan and depth bounds enforced
          - maintain deterministic error surfaces for doctor/lane recovery flows

    - id: "RMTREE-003"
      title: "Integration test: kill worker mid-gate, verify lane auto-recovers"
      detail: |
        Add a test that simulates worker crash during gate execution and
        verifies the lane recovers within 60s without manual intervention.
  requirement_clarifications:
    - "safe_rmtree pre-delete normalization must use handle-based directory operations (no symlink-following chmod path) and bounded traversal to prevent TOCTOU/DoS regressions."
    - "Directory mode repair must remain Linux-compatible: no `fchmodat` nofollow flag combinations rejected by the kernel; safety comes from nofollow directory handles."
    - "Lane recovery must remain doctor-driven and deterministic under repeated crash/restart cycles."

  out_of_scope:
    - "Changing broker_requests creation mode from 0333 to 0700 (Option C — may be considered separately)"
    - "Adding --force-unsafe-cleanup flag (Option B — unnecessary if Option A works)"

  affected_paths:
    - "crates/apm2-core/src/fac/safe_rmtree.rs"    # safe_rmtree_v1 implementation

impact: |
  - Reduces effective lane pool by 1 per occurrence (33% capacity loss with 3 lanes)
  - Requires operator intervention to recover — no self-healing
  - Accumulates tmp residue (observed 2024-20361 entries per incident)
  - Any worker restart or crash during gate execution triggers this
  - Frequency: ~1-3 times per day under active workload with periodic worker restarts

definition_of_done:
  criteria:
    - "Lane cleanup recovers from 0333-mode directories without manual chmod"
    - "doctor --fix succeeds on lanes corrupted by permission-denied tmp residue"
    - "No CORRUPT lanes after worker restart during active gate execution"
    - "Directory mode normalization does not fail with `EOPNOTSUPP` on Linux kernels when repairing user-owned directories."
    - "Integration test: kill worker mid-gate, verify lane auto-recovers within 60s"
