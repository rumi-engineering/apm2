      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Mint CapabilityManifestV1 only via policy resolver (no requester minting)
    - Enforce non-discoverability and scoped broker checks
    - 'Add laundering negatives: widened risk tier, missing expiry, overbroad scope'
    out_of_scope:
    - Delegation meet algorithm for permeability (TCK-00373)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Mint CapabilityManifestV1 only via policy resolver (no requester
      minting)'
    - 'Implement: Enforce non-discoverability and scoped broker checks'
    - 'Implement: Add laundering negatives: widened risk tier, missing expiry, overbroad
      scope'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0006
    - EVID-0305
    criteria:
    - Capability manifests cannot be minted by requester surfaces
    - Out-of-scope tool/path/host attempts denied with defects
    - Envelope-manifest hash mismatch always denies actuation
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
