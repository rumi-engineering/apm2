  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Add `apm2 fac review` command surface (`run`, `status`, `tail`) in apm2-cli; no xtask review orchestration changes."
      - "Implement parallel execution for `apm2 fac review run --type all` with independent `security` and `quality` workers."
      - "Cut over GitHub AI review projection to a unified workflow (`.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`) that uses `apm2 fac review`."
      - "Launch `security` and `quality` FAC reviewers in parallel from GitHub workflow execution."
      - "Emit one condensed reviewer-fleet status line per second in GitHub logs and print explicit error lines for crash/stall/fallback/SHA-update events."
      - "Use asynchronous workflow dispatch semantics: GitHub workflow launches detached FAC review processes and exits after a bounded 1Hz projection window."
      - "Support high concurrency (target up to 100 concurrent FAC review runs) without cross-PR state/pulse collisions."
      - "Implement idempotent review dispatch per `(repo, pr_number, review_type)` so duplicate requests for the same SHA do not spawn duplicate reviewers."
      - "Implement uniform random model selection across environment-available models (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, and `gpt-5.3-codex`)."
      - "Implement backend-aware command dispatch for Codex and Gemini initial spawn and resume paths."
      - "Emit append-only review lifecycle telemetry to `~/.apm2/review_events.ndjson` with rotation at 10MB."
      - "Implement PR-scoped pulse files for SHA freshness (`review_pulses/pr<PR>_review_pulse_{security|quality}.json`) and kill+resume on head movement."
      - "Implement liveness-based stall detection (event-stream primary, log-growth fallback) and bounded fallback restart policy."
      - "Persist active run metadata in FAC review state (`~/.apm2/review_state.json`) including PID, model, backend, and restart count."
      - "Update `documents/skills/orchestrator-monitor` scripts/docs to use FAC review commands and NDJSON/pulse telemetry."
      - "Keep GitHub review-gate authority semantics unchanged; this ticket only changes review execution orchestration."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Any modifications to xtask review/push/check implementation paths."
      - "Daemon-side authoritative receipt ingestion for FAC review runs in this phase."
      - "Changes to `.github/workflows/review-gate.yml` merge gate evaluation logic."
      - "Redesign of FAC policy-resolution, lease issuance, or merge executor internals."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Create a dedicated implementation worktree and keep all edits scoped to that worktree."
      - "Extend apm2-cli FAC subcommands to include `review` with `run/status/tail` flows and JSON/text output support."
      - "Add a FAC review module encapsulating model pool selection, backend routing, lifecycle state machine, and event emission."
      - "Implement parallel `run --type all` orchestration and per-review type execution loops with restart caps."
      - "Implement pulse monitor loop (`gh pr view --json headRefOid` polling) and session resume on SHA drift."
      - "Implement liveness monitor with 90s stall threshold and fallback model rotation on stall/crash/HTTP400-rate-limit signals."
      - "Add tests for model selection, fallback cycling, command builder dispatch, NDJSON append/rotation, pulse round-trip, and state compatibility."
      - "Rewrite orchestrator-monitor launch/check/poll assets to call `apm2 fac review` and parse FAC review telemetry/state files."
      - "Replace split AI-review workflows with unified `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`, launching security and quality reviews in parallel via FAC."
      - "Implement 1Hz projection logging in GitHub workflow using `apm2 fac --json review status --pr <N>` and explicit error-event lines."
      - "Change workflow execution from synchronous wait-until-complete to asynchronous detached dispatch with short projection loop to minimize runner occupancy and queue pressure."
      - "Run `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`, and `cargo test -p apm2-cli`."
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
      - "EVID-HEF-0017"
    criteria:
      - "`apm2 fac review run --type all <PR_URL>` dispatches security and quality in parallel and records NDJSON lifecycle events for each stream."
      - "Unified GitHub AI review workflow launches `security` and `quality` FAC review runs in parallel for the same PR head SHA."
      - "Unified GitHub AI review workflow does not block on review completion; it dispatches detached runs and exits after bounded projection output."
      - "GitHub run logs show one condensed status line per second with current reviewer-agent state and surface explicit error lines when faults appear."
      - "Concurrent duplicate dispatches for the same `(repo, PR, review_type, head_sha)` are deduplicated (idempotent), not queued."
      - "Review runs are observable through NDJSON lifecycle events and pulse/state files without relying on ad-hoc mtime/process greps."
      - "On SHA drift, active review sessions are terminated and resumed with preserved context via backend-native resume commands."
      - "On stall or crash, fallback model selection is applied with bounded restart attempts and explicit telemetry."
      - "orchestrator-monitor scripts are FAC-first and no longer depend on xtask review entrypoints."
      - "No xtask source files are modified by this ticket implementation."
  notes:
    security: |
      Enforce fail-closed behavior for ambiguous reviewer execution states.
      Pulse and telemetry artifacts are non-authoritative operational signals;
      merge authority remains review-gate based.
    verification: |
      Validate both unit-level command/state correctness and manual end-to-end
      behavior across normal, stall, crash, and SHA-move scenarios. Validate
      workflow-level parallel launch by pushing a PR branch and observing both
      reviewer agents start concurrently with 1Hz projection logs.
    general: |
      Implementation must remain FAC-first and worktree-scoped. The migration
      goal is to stop expanding xtask review orchestration and consolidate on
      `apm2 fac` runtime surfaces.
