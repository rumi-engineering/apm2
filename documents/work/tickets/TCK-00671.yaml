  summary: |
    APM2 already has multiple orchestration loops (gate orchestrator, work loop manager,
    FAC worker, FAC review) that all re-implement the same hard problems:

      - reading canonical events incrementally (cursor handling),
      - deterministic state folding + checkpointing,
      - effect execution with intent->receipt idempotency,
      - crash-point recovery and bounded work per tick,
      - liveness nudges / retry policies.

    Without a shared runtime harness, orchestration logic drifts, subtle bugs reappear,
    and new systems (FAC review, holon) tend to build bespoke frameworks.

    This ticket creates a shared OrchestratorKernel harness in apm2-core so all
    orchestrators converge on one tested controller loop suitable for scaling to
    100B agents.

      title: "Create apm2_core::orchestrator_kernel module via extraction, not invention"
      detail: |
        Implement a thin, mechanical controller loop by extracting existing primitives rather than building a generic framework.
        MUST extract and reuse:
          - `LedgerTailer` (from `crates/apm2-daemon/src/projection/worker.rs`) for durable cursoring and crash-safe resume.
          - `EffectJournal` (from `crates/apm2-daemon/src/admission_kernel/effect_journal.rs`) for crash-window classification and idempotent effect execution.
        
        The module (`controller_loop.rs` or similar) should provide a minimal API:
          - Observe -> Plan -> Execute -> Receipt
          - A simple `OrchestratorDomain` trait with `apply_events`, `plan` (returning durable intents), and `execute`.
          - Explicit backpressure (intent store / buffering) and timeout semantics.

        The harness must support:
          - bounded per-iteration work limits
          - crash-point safe execution ordering (intent -> op -> receipt)
          - deterministic replay tests

    - id: "OK-002"
      title: "Implement smallest orchestrator on the loop (e.g. timeout receipt generator) as reference"
      detail: |
        To de-risk the extraction without cementing a "framework," build the simplest possible orchestrator on the loop:
          - E.g., a "timeout receipt generator" that watches for expired leases and emits deterministic timeout receipts.
        
        This establishes the pattern:
          - observe ledger
          - plan timeout intent
          - execute via EffectJournal
          - emit ledger receipt
        
        The implementation should demonstrate:
          - restart-safe behavior
          - consolidation of cursor tracking and effect idempotency

    - id: "OK-003"
      title: "Verification suite for OrchestratorKernel"
      detail: |
        Add tests that:
          - prove replay determinism (genesis vs checkpoint+delta)
          - simulate crashes between intent/op/receipt and ensure safe replay
          - enforce bounded work per tick
          - optionally: simulate duplicate inputs and ensure idempotency

  out_of_scope:
    - Building a generic workflow engine or complex trait hierarchies.
    - Inventing a new event model or a new persistence store (must reuse existing SQLite/File stores).
    - Porting FAC Review immediately (this is the *target* for a follow-on ticket, not the test subject for the initial harness).
    - Refactoring all existing orchestrators in one shot.
    - Cementing the split between `apm2_core::ledger` and daemon ledger (the loop should abstract over a thin trait to allow future migration).

  critical_structural_boundaries:
    - id: "IMPL-01"
      title: "Crate Dependency Trap (apm2-core vs apm2-daemon)"
      detail: |
        LedgerTailer and EffectJournal implementations currently live in apm2-daemon. The loop must live in apm2-core.
        Do NOT create a circular dependency. Move the *traits* to apm2-core and inject the daemon *implementations*
        into the loop at runtime (e.g. via `&dyn EffectJournal`).
    - id: "IMPL-02"
      title: "The 'Two Ledgers' Schism"
      detail: |
        apm2_core uses the new BFT-ready ledger schema. The daemon uses a legacy SQLite schema.
        The loop MUST be written against an abstract `LedgerRead` trait. The implementor should create a
        `DaemonLedgerAdapter` in the daemon to wrap the legacy DB. Do not rewrite the database layer here.
    - id: "IMPL-03"
      title: "EffectJournal 'InDoubt' Resolution"
      detail: |
        When an effect is left in an 'Unknown' crash-window state, the loop must explicitly handle it.
        It must NOT blindly retry (which breaks idempotency for external APIs). It must either query the external
        state or emit a 'Blocked/NeedsIntervention' ledger receipt and fail-closed for that intent.
    - id: "IMPL-04"
      title: "Intent Buffering (Plan vs Execute Seam)"
      detail: |
        The loop's `Plan` phase may generate 10,000 intents. `Execute` cannot process them in one tick.
        Intents MUST be durably buffered (e.g., a simple SQLite `intent_store` table) before execution. The loop then
        pulls bounded batches (e.g., LIMIT 50) from this buffer for the `Execute` phase.

plan:
  steps:
    - Extract `LedgerTailer` into a shared module (currently in projection worker).
    - Reuse `EffectJournal` (currently in admission kernel).
    - Implement a thin controller loop `run_loop(domain, deps, cfg)`.
    - Implement the smallest orchestrator (e.g. timeout receipt generator) as the reference driver.
    - Add determinism/crash/idempotency tests for the new loop.

definition_of_done:
  criteria:
    - "apm2_core::orchestrator_kernel exists with cursor/reducer/driver/checkpoint/tick interfaces."
    - "At least one daemon orchestrator runs on the harness and passes existing tests."
    - "New tests cover determinism + crash-point recovery + boundedness."
    - "Extracts LedgerTailer and EffectJournal rather than creating net-new equivalents."

risks:
  - id: "R-OK-01"
    title: "Over-generalizing the harness creates friction and slows refactors"
    mitigation: |
      Keep the kernel minimal and opinionated: event-sourced reducers + intent/receipt idempotency.
      Avoid modeling every possible orchestrator; expand only when a second consumer needs it.
