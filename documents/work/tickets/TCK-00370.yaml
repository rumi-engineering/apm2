  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement FactRootV1 and bind batch roots into QC-certified checkpoints
    - Require ledger/quorum anchors for authoritative batch acceptance
    - Integrate FactRoot verification path in receipt pointer verifier
    out_of_scope:
    - Hierarchical batch forests (TCK-00371)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement FactRootV1 and bind batch roots into QC-certified checkpoints'
    - 'Implement: Require ledger/quorum anchors for authoritative batch acceptance'
    - 'Implement: Integrate FactRoot verification path in receipt pointer verifier'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0024
    - EVID-0306
    criteria:
    - BFT-mode batch roots are checkpoint-composed by default
    - Verifier supports QC + FactRoot proof path
    - Free-floating batch roots are not accepted for authority
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
