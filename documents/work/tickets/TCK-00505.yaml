  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Insert a call to evaluate_projection_continuity() in ProjectionWorker::handle_review_receipt() before adapter.project_status()."
      - "Assemble gate inputs from the ReviewReceiptRecorded event payload: extract eval_tick, time_authority_ref, window_ref, boundary_id."
      - "On ALLOW verdict: proceed to adapter.project_status() and record admitted intent in IntentBuffer."
      - "On DENY verdict: record denied intent in IntentBuffer with structured deny reason, skip projection, log verdict."
      - "Fail closed if gate inputs cannot be assembled (missing temporal authority, missing profile, missing snapshot)."
      - "Emit structured telemetry for admit/deny counts per sink."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Deferred replay logic for buffered intents after outage recovery (see TCK-00508)."
      - "Multi-sink dispatch routing (single GitHub sink for now)."
      - "Economics gate logic changes — this ticket only calls existing gates."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Add apm2-core economics dependency to apm2-daemon Cargo.toml if not already present."
      - "In handle_review_receipt(), after PR metadata lookup and before adapter.project_status(), build ContinuityCheckInputs."
      - "Load continuity profile and sink snapshot via profile resolver (TCK-00507 dependency)."
      - "Call evaluate_projection_continuity() with assembled inputs."
      - "Branch on verdict: ALLOW -> project + record admit; DENY -> record deny + skip."
      - "Add structured log lines (tracing) for both paths with verdict details."
      - "Write integration-style tests using mock adapter and mock profile resolver."

    criteria:
      - "No projection occurs without passing the economics admission gate."
      - "Missing gate inputs (temporal authority, profile, snapshot) result in DENY, not default ALLOW."
      - "Admitted projections produce a receipt recorded in the intent buffer."
      - "Denied projections are logged with structured deny reason and recorded in intent buffer."
      - "Existing projection behavior is preserved when gate returns ALLOW."
  notes:
    security: |
      This is the critical wiring point. The gate MUST be fail-closed: if any input
      assembly step fails (missing field, deserialization error, profile not found),
      the default MUST be DENY. Never skip the gate — every projection path must
      pass through it.
    verification: |
      Include tests for: (1) normal ALLOW path preserves existing behavior,
      (2) DENY path skips projection, (3) missing temporal authority -> DENY,
      (4) missing profile -> DENY, (5) gate error -> DENY.
    general: |
      This is the highest-value integration ticket — it turns the economics gates
      from inert validation code into an active admission barrier on the production
      projection path.
