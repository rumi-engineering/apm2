  root_cause_analysis:
    summary: |
      `build_recommended_action()` in
      `crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_review/mod.rs:2334-2442` is the
      brain of the orchestrator control loop. The orchestrator-monitor
      agent polls doctor, reads `recommended_action`, and reacts. Every
      orchestrator decision routes through this single function.

      The function emits 6 actions. Two have executable commands; four do
      not. The two WITH commands (`fix`, `restart_reviews`) work flawlessly
      in the field — the orchestrator runs the command and polls again. The
      four WITHOUT commands (`dispatch_implementor`, `merge`, `escalate`,
      `wait`) are exactly where every field failure occurred, because the
      orchestrator LLM must improvise what to do next.

      Current action cascade:

          1. integrity/corruption  → "fix"                 command: ✓
          2. merge_ready           → "merge"               command: ✗
          3. merge conflicts       → "escalate"            command: ✗
          4. deny/blocker/major    → "dispatch_implementor" command: ✗
          5. no agents + pending   → "restart_reviews"     command: ✓
          6. budget exhausted      → "escalate"            command: ✗
          7. default               → "wait"                command: ✗

      Five defects compound this structural gap:

      DEFECT 1: dispatch_implementor fires before all verdicts are in

      The check at lines 2379-2393 fires when ANY dimension has
      deny/blocker/major, without verifying that ALL dimensions have
      non-pending formal_verdicts:

          let requires_implementor_remediation = input.findings_summary.iter().any(|entry| {
              entry.formal_verdict.eq_ignore_ascii_case("deny")
                  || entry.counts.blocker > 0
                  || entry.counts.major > 0
          });
          if requires_implementor_remediation { ... }

      The has_pending_verdict check exists at line 2396-2399 but is only
      used in the restart_reviews branch. The dispatch_implementor branch
      never consults it. Impact: orchestrator dispatches implementors with
      partial findings, then dispatches again when the second dimension
      completes. Double dispatch, wasted resources, possible conflicts.

      DEFECT 2: dispatch_implementor has command: None

      The orchestrator-monitor skill devotes an entire 8-step node
      (FIX_AGENT_PROMPT_CONTRACT) to constructing the implementor
      dispatch. It must assemble: ticket ID, PR number, branch, HEAD SHA,
      worktree path, findings list, and the implementor skill reference.
      All of this information is already available inside
      build_recommended_action() (via DoctorActionInputs and the
      DoctorPrSummary being constructed). But command is None, so the
      LLM must re-derive it from raw JSON fields.

      Compare with restart_reviews (lines 2405-2421) which constructs a
      complete command including --force and --refresh-identity flags
      based on terminal_reason analysis. The dispatch_implementor branch
      should follow the same pattern.

      DEFECT 3: merge action is unreachable in practice

      Auto-merge fires synchronously inside `finalize_projected_verdict()`
      at lifecycle.rs:2128 via `maybe_auto_merge_if_ready()`. This runs
      in the reviewer agent's process during `verdict set`. By the time
      the orchestrator polls doctor:

        - If auto-merge succeeded: lifecycle_state=merged. But
          build_recommended_action() never checks lifecycle state for
          merged — it has no branch for "this PR is already done." The
          function either returns "merge" (if merge_ready is still true
          from stale verdict/gate data) or falls through to "wait."
          Neither is correct. The orchestrator needs "done."

        - If auto-merge failed: lifecycle has a MergeFailed event.
          merge_ready may still be true (verdicts approve, gates pass,
          sha fresh) because merge_ready doesn't check for MergeFailed
          events. Doctor would emit "merge" — but the merge already
          failed. The orchestrator can't do anything with this.

      The field report confirms: "the merge action never fired because
      the PR isn't merged by the CLI." The orchestrator used
      --exit-on dispatch_implementor,merge but the happy path (all
      approve → auto-merge → done) never produced an exit signal.

      DEFECT 4: wait action has no command

      The terminal fallback (line 2436-2441) returns command: None. The
      orchestrator receives "wait" with no actionable next step. It must
      independently decide to poll again, construct the poll command
      with the right flags, and manage timing — all LLM reasoning that
      should be deterministic.

      DEFECT 5: escalate action has no command

      Both escalate paths (merge conflicts at line 2370, budget exhaustion
      at line 2427) return command: None. The orchestrator receives
      "escalate" but has no guidance on what escalation looks like.

      ROOT CAUSE PATTERN

      Doctor was built as a diagnostic tool for humans. Its action
      vocabulary and command surface were designed for a human to read
      "dispatch_implementor" and know what to do. But the primary
      consumer is now the orchestrator-monitor agent — an LLM in a
      tight poll loop making programmatic decisions. Every action
      without a command is a gap where the LLM must improvise, which
      is expensive, slow, and error-prone.

      The two actions WITH commands (fix, restart_reviews) never appear
      in bug reports. The four WITHOUT commands are the source of every
      field failure. The fix is to close the command gap: every action
      must carry an executable command or sufficient structured context
      for the orchestrator to act without re-deriving state.

    - id: S1_GATE_DISPATCH_ON_ALL_VERDICTS
      title: "Gate dispatch_implementor on all expected verdicts being non-pending"
      detail: |
        In `build_recommended_action()` at
        `crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_review/mod.rs:2379-2393`:

        Add a check that ALL expected dimensions have a non-pending
        formal_verdict before emitting dispatch_implementor. If any
        dimension is still pending, fall through to wait.

        Current logic (lines 2379-2393):
            let requires_implementor_remediation = input.findings_summary.iter().any(|entry| {
                entry.formal_verdict.eq_ignore_ascii_case("deny")
                    || entry.counts.blocker > 0
                    || entry.counts.major > 0
            });
            if requires_implementor_remediation {
                return DoctorRecommendedAction {
                    action: "dispatch_implementor".to_string(), ...
                };
            }

        Fixed logic:
            let all_verdicts_resolved = !input.findings_summary.iter().any(|entry| {
                entry.formal_verdict.eq_ignore_ascii_case("pending")
            });
            let requires_implementor_remediation = input.findings_summary.iter().any(|entry| {
                entry.formal_verdict.eq_ignore_ascii_case("deny")
                    || entry.counts.blocker > 0
                    || entry.counts.major > 0
            });
            if requires_implementor_remediation && all_verdicts_resolved {
                return DoctorRecommendedAction {
                    action: "dispatch_implementor".to_string(), ...
                };
            }

        The existing has_pending_verdict variable at line 2399 is scoped
        inside a later block. Either hoist it above the dispatch check or
        compute all_verdicts_resolved independently.

        Acceptance:
          - Security finishes with "deny", code-quality still "pending" →
            doctor recommends "wait", NOT "dispatch_implementor".
          - Both dimensions finish (security=deny, code-quality=approve) →
            doctor recommends "dispatch_implementor".
          - Both dimensions finish with deny → doctor recommends
            "dispatch_implementor" with the complete findings set.

    - id: S2_DISPATCH_IMPLEMENTOR_COMMAND
      title: "Populate command and context on dispatch_implementor action"
      detail: |
        In `build_recommended_action()`, the dispatch_implementor return
        at lines 2387-2392 has `command: None`.

        Doctor already has all the information the orchestrator needs to
        construct the implementor dispatch — it is available either in
        DoctorActionInputs or in the DoctorPrSummary being built by the
        caller (run_doctor_inner). The minimal viable command is:

            command: Some(format!(
                "apm2 fac doctor --pr {} --json",
                input.pr_number
            ))

        This tells the orchestrator: "run this command to get the full
        context you need for the implementor handoff." But this is already
        what the orchestrator does, so it adds minimal value.

        The higher-value approach: add a structured `context` field to
        DoctorRecommendedAction that carries the implementor-relevant
        data inline. But DoctorRecommendedAction is a serialized public
        struct — adding a field is a schema change.

        The pragmatic middle ground: populate `command` with an
        `apm2 fac review findings --pr <N> --json` command (gives the
        orchestrator the exact findings to include in the handoff), and
        include the reason field with enough structured detail for the
        orchestrator to act:

            command: Some(format!(
                "apm2 fac review findings --pr {}",
                input.pr_number
            ))

        Additionally, enrich the `reason` field to include the dimension
        verdicts and finding counts inline, so the orchestrator does not
        need to cross-reference findings_summary separately. Example:

            reason: "security=deny(2B/1M) code-quality=approve(0B/0M/1m/3N); review findings require implementor remediation"

        This mirrors the field report request for "a merged view showing
        security: APPROVE (0B/0M/0m/2N) in one field."

        Acceptance:
          - dispatch_implementor action has command != None.
          - reason includes per-dimension verdict and finding counts.
          - Orchestrator can construct implementor handoff from
            recommended_action alone without parsing findings_summary.

    - id: S3_MERGED_AND_APPROVE_ACTIONS
      title: "Add 'done' action for merged PRs and 'approve' for all-verdicts-approve"
      detail: |
        build_recommended_action() currently has no branch for two states
        the orchestrator needs:

        (a) PR is already merged (lifecycle.state == "merged"):

            The function never checks lifecycle state for the merged
            terminal. When auto-merge succeeds via
            maybe_auto_merge_if_ready() (lifecycle.rs:2006-2097), the
            lifecycle transitions to "merged" — but build_recommended_action
            falls through to "merge" (if merge_ready is still true) or
            "wait". Neither is correct.

            Add a check early in the cascade (after the integrity check,
            before merge_ready):

                if let Some(lifecycle) = input.lifecycle {
                    if lifecycle.state.eq_ignore_ascii_case("merged") {
                        return DoctorRecommendedAction {
                            action: "done".to_string(),
                            reason: "PR has been merged to main".to_string(),
                            priority: "low".to_string(),
                            command: None,
                        };
                    }
                }

        (b) All verdicts approve but merge_ready is false
            (e.g., gates not yet cached, sha_freshness unknown):

            The orchestrator's happy-path classification is READY_TO_MERGE,
            which requires only all_verdicts_approve — NOT the full
            merge_ready conjunction (gates_pass + sha_fresh +
            no_merge_conflicts). When all verdicts approve, auto-merge
            will fire (or already fired). The orchestrator just needs to
            know "all reviews are done and they all approve" so it can
            stop dispatching implementors and wait for auto-merge.

            Add a check after the merge_ready check:

                if input.merge_readiness.all_verdicts_approve {
                    return DoctorRecommendedAction {
                        action: "approve".to_string(),
                        reason: "all review dimensions approve; awaiting auto-merge".to_string(),
                        priority: "low".to_string(),
                        command: Some(format!(
                            "apm2 fac doctor --pr {} --json --wait-for-recommended-action",
                            input.pr_number
                        )),
                    };
                }

        Update DOCTOR_WAIT_EXIT_ACTIONS to include "done" and "approve":

            const DOCTOR_WAIT_EXIT_ACTIONS: [&str; 7] = [
                "fix", "escalate", "merge", "dispatch_implementor",
                "restart_reviews", "done", "approve",
            ];

        Update DoctorExitActionArg enum to include Done and Approve
        variants with corresponding as_str() mappings.

        The action cascade becomes:

            1. integrity/corruption    → "fix"                  command: ✓
            2. lifecycle=merged        → "done"                 command: ✓ (None — terminal)
            3. merge_ready             → "merge"                command: ✓ (None — terminal)
            4. all_verdicts_approve    → "approve"              command: ✓
            5. merge conflicts         → "escalate"             command: ✓
            6. deny/blocker/major      → "dispatch_implementor" command: ✓
               (gated on all_verdicts_resolved)
            7. no agents + pending     → "restart_reviews"      command: ✓
            8. budget exhausted        → "escalate"             command: ✓
            9. default                 → "wait"                 command: ✓

        Acceptance:
          - Merged PR returns action="done".
          - All verdicts approve (but merge_ready=false) returns
            action="approve".
          - Orchestrator using --exit-on approve exits on happy path
            without needing to parse merge_readiness fields.
          - Orchestrator using --exit-on done can detect post-merge
            state without parsing lifecycle.state.

        Two remaining actions with command: None.

        WAIT (lines 2436-2441):
        Change to:
            command: Some(format!(

                input.pr_number

        The escalate command points back to doctor because escalation
        requires human review of the full doctor output. The command
        gives the orchestrator something to report when it escalates.

        Acceptance:
          - Every action in the cascade has command != None (or command
            is intentionally None only for terminal actions like "done"
            and "merge" where no further CLI action is needed).
          - Orchestrator never receives a non-terminal action with no

      title: "Remove duplicate ticket YAMLs from RFC-0019 amendment A1"
      detail: |
        `documents/rfcs/RFC-0019/20_fac_execution_substrate_build_farm_revision.md`
        contained a "17. Ticket YAMLs (drop-in proposals)" section starting at
        line 1876 with ~4135 lines of inline ticket YAML proposals (TCK-00510,
        TCK-00511, and others). These are duplicates of tickets that have since
        been properly created in `documents/work/tickets/`.

        The section has been removed. The canonical ticket location is
        `documents/work/tickets/TCK-NNNNN.yaml` — RFC amendment files should
        reference tickets by ID, not embed full YAML copies.

        This change is already applied (4135 lines deleted, 1 trailing
        newline inserted).

        Acceptance:
          - No `ticket_meta:` blocks remain in the RFC amendment file.
          - The file ends cleanly after the "warm and GC interfaces /
            compute lease concept / Nix reproduction" outline.

    - id: S8_HARDEN_STUCK_STALE_AGENT_DETECTION
      title: "Harden detection of stuck/stale agents so orchestrators don't have to"
      detail: |
        The agent registry (lifecycle.rs) tracks `TrackedAgent` entries with
        state transitions: Dispatched → Running → Completed/Crashed/Reaped.
        The reaper (`reap_registry_stale_entries()` at lifecycle.rs:1680-1762)
        auto-reaps agents with dead PIDs or no PID after 240s. But
        `build_recommended_action()` has no awareness of agent staleness —
        it only checks `active_agents == 0` for the restart_reviews branch.

        Three gaps force orchestrators to manually detect and recover stuck
        agents:

        GAP 1: IDLE RUNNING AGENTS NOT DETECTED

        Doctor already collects `last_activity_seconds_ago` (age of most
        recent event from review events log) and `elapsed_seconds` (time
        since agent started) in DoctorAgentSnapshot, but
        build_recommended_action() never consults these. An agent in Running
        state with a live PID but zero activity for 30+ minutes will produce
        action="wait" indefinitely.

        Fix: Before the terminal "wait" fallback, check active agents for
        staleness. If ALL active agents have `last_activity_seconds_ago >
        AGENT_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (e.g., 300 seconds), emit action="restart_reviews"
        with reason "all active reviewer agents are idle (no activity for
        {N}s); recommend restart" and command pointing to
        `apm2 fac restart --pr <N> --force --refresh-identity`.

        This requires adding agent snapshot data to DoctorActionInputs.
        Currently DoctorActionInputs carries `active_agents: usize` (a
        count). Extend it to carry a lightweight activity summary:

            pub struct DoctorAgentActivitySummary {
                pub active_agents: usize,
                pub all_active_idle: bool,       // all active agents idle > threshold
                pub max_idle_seconds: Option<u64>, // worst-case idle time
            }

        GAP 2: DISPATCHED-NEVER-RUNNING NOT SURFACED

        The reaper handles Dispatched-without-PID after 240s TTL, but doctor
        recommends "wait" during that entire window. The orchestrator sees
        "wait" and has no way to know a dispatch may have failed.

        Fix: If any agent is in Dispatched state with elapsed > 120s (the
        base DISPATCH_PENDING_TTL), include a warning in the recommended
        action reason: "reviewer dispatch pending for {N}s (may be stuck)".
        This doesn't change the action — the reaper will handle cleanup —
        but gives the orchestrator visibility.

        GAP 3: DOCTOR --FIX SHOULD AUTO-REAP AND RESTART

        Currently `derive_doctor_repair_plan()` (mod.rs:1365-1404) sets
        `reap_stale_agents = true` when it detects dead-PID agents or
        capacity overflow. But it does NOT trigger a restart after reaping.
        The orchestrator must poll again, see restart_reviews, and execute
        it — an extra round-trip.

        Fix: In `run_repair_plan()`, after reaping stale agents, if verdicts
        are still pending and active_agents drops to zero, also execute a
        restart (equivalent to `apm2 fac restart --pr <N>`). Log the
        compound repair: "reaped stale agents and restarted reviews."

        Acceptance:
          - Running agent with no activity for >300s triggers
            action="restart_reviews" (not "wait").
          - Dispatched agent pending for >120s includes warning text in
            recommended_action.reason.
          - `apm2 fac doctor --pr <N> --fix` reaps stale agents AND
            restarts reviews in a single invocation when applicable.
          - Orchestrator control loop no longer needs IDLE_AGENT_RECOVERY
            step (180s timeout) — doctor handles it.

    - id: S9_UPDATE_ORCHESTRATOR_MONITOR_SKILL
      title: "Update orchestrator-monitor SKILL.md for new action vocabulary"
      detail: |
        `documents/skills/orchestrator-monitor/SKILL.md` must be updated to
        reflect the changes in S1-S8. The orchestrator's control loop
        simplifies dramatically when every action has a command.

        CHANGES REQUIRED:

        1. SIMPLIFY HEARTBEAT_LOOP CLASSIFY step (line 88-91):

           The 8-state classification (MERGED, READY_TO_MERGE, PR_CONFLICTING,
           CI_FAILED, REVIEW_FAILED, REVIEW_MISSING, WAITING_CI,
           BLOCKED_UNKNOWN) is now largely redundant — doctor's action
           vocabulary covers these states directly:
             - MERGED            → doctor action "done"
             - READY_TO_MERGE    → doctor action "approve" or "merge"
             - PR_CONFLICTING    → doctor action "escalate" (conflicts)
             - REVIEW_FAILED     → doctor action "dispatch_implementor"
             - REVIEW_MISSING    → doctor action "restart_reviews"
             - WAITING_CI        → doctor action "wait"
             - BLOCKED_UNKNOWN   → doctor action "escalate" (budget)
             - CI_FAILED         → doctor action "fix"

           Update CLASSIFY to: "Read recommended_action from doctor output.
           The action field is the authoritative classification." Keep the
           state names as documentation labels but stop requiring the
           orchestrator to derive them from raw JSON fields.

        2. SIMPLIFY EXECUTE_ACTIONS node (lines 102-121):

           Currently 5 sub-steps with manual logic per state. Replace with
           a command-driven dispatch pattern:

             - If action has command: execute the command.
             - If action is terminal (done, merge): record completion, move on.
             - If action is "dispatch_implementor": execute command to get
               findings, then dispatch implementor with handoff payload.

           The READY_TO_MERGE_ACTION ("check main branch... check again
           shortly until merged") is replaced by polling with
           `--exit-on done` — auto-merge handles the actual merge.

        3. SIMPLIFY FIX_AGENT_PROMPT_CONTRACT node (lines 165-195):

           The 8-step prompt construction is now partially addressed by
           dispatch_implementor having a command and enriched reason with
           per-dimension verdicts. The node should focus on what the
           orchestrator ADDS beyond what doctor provides:
             - Ticket ID (from orchestrator context, not doctor)
             - Worktree path (from orchestrator state)
             - implementor skill invocation syntax

           The node no longer needs to: derive findings from raw
           findings_summary JSON, compute HEAD SHA, or determine which
           dimensions failed — this is all in the enriched reason.

        4. UPDATE operational_playbook scenarios (lines 214-263):

           Add new scenarios:
             - trigger: "Doctor reports action=done"
               action: "PR is complete. Remove from active monitoring set."
             - trigger: "Doctor reports action=approve"
               action: "All reviews approve. Poll with --exit-on done to
               await auto-merge completion."
             - trigger: "Doctor reports stuck/idle agents"
               action: "Follow recommended_action.command (restart with
               --force). Do not manually inspect agent logs."

           Update existing scenarios to reference command field:
             - "dispatch_implementor" scenario: "Execute
               recommended_action.command to retrieve findings, then
               construct implementor handoff."
             - "wait" scenario: "Execute recommended_action.command (polls
               with --wait-for-recommended-action)."

        5. REMOVE IDLE_AGENT_RECOVERY from STALL_AND_BACKPRESSURE (line 133):

           The 180s idle agent timeout is now handled by doctor (S8). Remove
           the orchestrator-side idle detection. Keep ENFORCE_BACKPRESSURE
           but simplify: doctor's action already accounts for capacity.

        6. UPDATE invariants (lines 265-275):

           Add: "When doctor provides recommended_action.command, execute it
           verbatim. Do not re-derive commands from raw JSON fields."
           Add: "Use --exit-on done to detect PR completion instead of
           parsing lifecycle.state from doctor JSON."

        7. ADD simplified control loop pattern to notes (lines 24-29):

           The ideal orchestrator loop is now:
               for pr in scope:
                 loop:
                   result = apm2 fac doctor --pr {pr} --json \
                       --wait-for-recommended-action \
                       --exit-on done
                   match result.action:
                     "done" → break
                     "dispatch_implementor" → dispatch_with_handoff(result)
                     _ → execute(result.command)

           Document this pattern in notes as the canonical control loop.

        Acceptance:
          - SKILL.md references "done" and "approve" as valid doctor actions.
          - FIX_AGENT_PROMPT_CONTRACT simplified to focus on orchestrator-
            added context (ticket ID, worktree, skill invocation), not
            re-deriving findings from raw JSON.
          - IDLE_AGENT_RECOVERY removed or replaced with "doctor handles
            stuck agent detection."
          - Operational playbook has scenarios for done, approve, and
            stuck-agent recovery.
          - The simplified control loop pattern is documented.

    - id: S10_UPDATE_IMPLEMENTOR_DEFAULT_SKILL
      title: "Update implementor-default SKILL.md for doctor integration awareness"
      detail: |
        `documents/skills/implementor-default/SKILL.md` needs targeted
        updates to align with the new doctor action vocabulary. The
        implementor workflow itself doesn't change — implementors still
        write code, run gates, and push. But the context they receive from
        orchestrator handoffs changes because the orchestrator now gets
        richer information from doctor.

        CHANGES REQUIRED:

        1. UPDATE FETCH_REVIEW_FINDINGS step (START node, line 82-88):

           Currently says:
               `apm2 fac review findings --pr <PR_NUMBER> --json`

           This is correct and unchanged. But add a note that orchestrator
           handoffs now include per-dimension verdict summaries from
           doctor's enriched dispatch_implementor reason (e.g.,
           "security=deny(2B/1M) code-quality=approve"). The implementor
           should still fetch full findings via the command, but can use
           the summary for triage priority.

        2. ADD awareness of doctor action gating in orientation/notes:

           The implementor should know that it is only dispatched AFTER all
           review dimensions have completed (S1 gating). This means:
             - The findings set is COMPLETE — no more reviews are pending.
             - The implementor should address ALL findings across ALL
               dimensions in a single pass, not just the dimension that
               triggered dispatch.
             - There will be no surprise "second dispatch" for a later
               dimension completing.

        3. UPDATE references section (lines 20-57):

           Verify the RFC-0019 amendment reference at line 26 still points
           to a valid file (it does — we cleaned up the amendment in S7
           but didn't remove valid content). No change needed unless the
           file path changed.

        Acceptance:
          - SKILL.md notes that dispatch occurs only after all verdicts
            are resolved.
          - FETCH_REVIEW_FINDINGS step mentions orchestrator handoff
            includes per-dimension summary.
          - No broken references after S7 amendment cleanup.

  out_of_scope:
    - "Adding a full `apm2 fac dispatch-implementor --pr <N>` CLI verb that autonomously launches an implementor agent. This would be the ideal long-term fix for S2, but is a large change requiring agent lifecycle management in the CLI. The pragmatic S2 fix (command + enriched reason) is sufficient to close the orchestrator improvisation gap."
    - "Adding `apm2 fac merge --pr <N>` CLI verb. Auto-merge via maybe_auto_merge_if_ready() handles the merge path; the new 'done' and 'approve' actions make the merged/approved state observable to orchestrators."
    - "Changing the --wait-for-recommended-action poll loop mechanics (the loop correctly polls until action matches exit_on; this ticket changes what actions are emitted, not how the loop works)."
    - "Adding --repo filter or --exclude-examples to global doctor mode (useful but separate concern from the action cascade)."
    - "Adding --active-only or --current-sha-only agent filtering (useful but orthogonal to the action command gap)."
    - "Adding worktree_status.behind_main_by field (useful but orthogonal)."

    ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT

    The orchestrator-monitor agent (documents/skills/orchestrator-monitor/
    SKILL.md) is a reactive controller. It polls doctor, reads
    recommended_action, and acts. Every orchestrator decision routes
    through build_recommended_action() — that function IS the control
    plane.

    The orchestrator classifies each PR into one of 8 states (MERGED,
    READY_TO_MERGE, PR_CONFLICTING, CI_FAILED, REVIEW_FAILED,
    REVIEW_MISSING, WAITING_CI, BLOCKED_UNKNOWN). But doctor only emits
    6 actions. The mapping is lossy — the orchestrator LLM must
    re-derive state from raw JSON fields to fill the gap.

    FIELD EVIDENCE

    From multi-PR orchestration runs:

    1. dispatch_implementor fires when security denies but code-quality
       is still pending. Orchestrator dispatches with partial findings.
       Code-quality finishes → second dispatch_implementor → double
       dispatch.

    2. "merge action never fired because the PR isn't merged by the CLI."
       Orchestrator used --exit-on dispatch_implementor,merge for happy
       path detection. But auto-merge fires in the reviewer's verdict-set
       codepath (lifecycle.rs:2128 → maybe_auto_merge_if_ready), not via
       doctor. By the time doctor polls, either the PR is merged (but
       doctor has no "done" action) or auto-merge hasn't fired yet (but
       doctor has no "approve" action distinct from "merge"). The
       orchestrator's happy path has no exit signal.

    3. All command:None actions required LLM improvisation. The
       orchestrator-monitor skill devotes an 8-step
       FIX_AGENT_PROMPT_CONTRACT to constructing the implementor dispatch
       — work that exists solely because dispatch_implementor has no
       command.

    THE FIX PATTERN

    Two actions WITH commands (fix, restart_reviews) never appear in bug
    reports. Four WITHOUT commands are the source of every field failure.
    Close the command gap and the orchestrator reduces to:

        loop:
          result = apm2 fac doctor --pr N --json \
              --wait-for-recommended-action \
              --exit-on done
          if result.action == "done": break
          execute(result.command)

    Every action becomes either:
    - Terminal (done, merge): orchestrator observes and moves on
    - Actionable (fix, restart_reviews, dispatch_implementor, wait,
      approve, escalate): orchestrator executes the command

    The LLM reasoning is reserved for the implementor (actual code
    changes) and the reviewer (actual code review). The orchestrator
    control loop becomes deterministic.
  security: "default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed"
