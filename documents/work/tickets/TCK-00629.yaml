    tickets:

      reason: Core-ledger migration must land first (Phase 0 prerequisite)
    - ticket_id: TCK-00655
      reason: System acceptance tests must be green before promotion
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Track RFC-0032 implementation phases (0-6) as discrete mergeable tickets
    - 'Maintain cross-ticket invariants: ledger+CAS reconstructibility, bounded decoding, topic derivation tests, parity gates fail-closed'
    - Ensure acceptance tests AT-0..AT-5 exist and are promotion-blocking in production mode
    - Coordinate deprecation/removal sequencing for WorkRegistry authority and legacy ledger writers
    out_of_scope:
    - Implement code changes directly (handled by dependent tickets)
    - Redesign actor identity / cryptographic model beyond vNext (explicitly deferred by RFC-0032)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Keep dependency graph current; update this ticket when child tickets are added/merged
    - Maintain a 'Phase checklist' section in RFC-0032 tracking migration readiness signals (metrics/tests/gates)
    - Run AT-0..AT-5 on every promotion candidate; treat failures as promotion-blocking
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids: []
    criteria:
    - All Phase 0-6 tickets required for vNext are MERGED.
    - All drift-control guardrails are implemented with tests (schema registry allowlist, topic derivation coverage, parity gates).
    - AT-0..AT-5 pass in CI and can be executed locally against a seeded legacy DB.
    - No daemon codepath can append to legacy `ledger_events` in production mode.
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed by default; do not weaken existing promotion-blocking gates (alias reconciliation, parity/merge gates).
    verification: Track and publish a reproducible end-to-end demo script exercising AT-0..AT-5.
