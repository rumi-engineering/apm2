      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Encode functorial law constraints for optimization rewrites
    - Admit rewrite classes only when observation preservation is proven
    - Link rewrite policy to formal artifact review gate
    out_of_scope:
    - Active-inference planner objective integration (TCK-00369)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Encode functorial law constraints for optimization rewrites'
    - 'Implement: Admit rewrite classes only when observation preservation is proven'
    - 'Implement: Link rewrite policy to formal artifact review gate'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0022
    - EVID-0401
    criteria:
    - Admitted rewrite catalog references proof obligations
    - Non-proven rewrites are blocked from release pipelines
    - Optimization does not change observable HSI truth semantics
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
