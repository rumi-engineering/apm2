    tickets:
    - ticket_id: TCK-00638
      reason: Needs PublishWorkContextEntry
    - ticket_id: TCK-00639
      reason: Needs RecordWorkPrAssociation
    - ticket_id: TCK-00636
      reason: Needs ticket-alias -> work_id resolution
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Resolve `work_id` deterministically for `apm2 fac push` via priority order: explicit `--work-id`, branch ticket alias (`TCK-*`), then daemon-side claim/projection recovery
    - 'After push/PR update: call daemon RPCs in order: PublishChangeSet(work_id), RecordWorkPrAssociation, PublishWorkContextEntry(HANDOFF_NOTE optional), PublishWorkContextEntry(IMPLEMENTER_TERMINAL required)'
    - Enforce terminal contract from ledger+CAS truth: IMPLEMENTER_TERMINAL is mandatory per push attempt; HANDOFF_NOTE is optional
    - Keep CLI non-authoritative for lifecycle transitions (no direct `work.transitioned` emission)
    - Remove legacy work-event envelope decode branches from projection rebuild; enforce session-envelope contract (`event_type`, `session_id`, `actor_id`, `payload`) while allowing extension fields
    - Restore daemon authoritative lease/work continuity for pre-cutover claims by allowing controlled `work_claims` fallback when `gate_lease_issued` rows are absent; authoritative lease rows must take precedence
    - Ensure migration fallback fails closed on ambiguous lease bindings and invalid empty bindings
    - Keep lease fallback lookup bounded and indexed (`work_claims.lease_id`) to avoid unbounded scans
    - Stream periodic progress diagnostics during `apm2 fac push` gate execution and publication steps
    - Prevent one-shot inline worker fallback cycles from spawning persistent queue watcher/watchdog threads so `fac push` cannot leak inotify instances/threads under retries
    - Run authoritative PR-association compatibility preflight before expensive gate execution (fail fast on work_id/PR conflicts)
    - Preserve queue claim lock ownership through terminal transition commit paths so no second worker can re-claim mid-transition
    - Enforce case-insensitive `(work_id, pr_number, commit_sha)` uniqueness for `work.pr_associated` in both legacy and canonical sqlite schemas
    out_of_scope:
    - Daemon-side CI processor transitions (separate ticket)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Keep CLI argument surface for explicit work binding while defaulting to branch alias/work-claim resolution for manual operator flow
    - Thread resolved `work_id` through PublishChangeSet, PR association, and context publication calls
    - Ensure idempotent retries with stable dedupe keys and scoped lease->work recovery behavior
    - Harden daemon lease validator fallback semantics (authoritative precedence, ambiguity refusal, indexed lookup path)
    - Make `--handoff-note` optional; always emit IMPLEMENTER_TERMINAL marker
    - Harden projection rebuild decoder to current session envelope contract and remove historical raw/payload-only branches
    - Add early PR-association preflight to `fac push` fast checks (non-mutating validation path)
    - Keep claimed lock file descriptor held until terminal queue mutation finishes
    - Harden PR-association tuple dedupe/indexes to normalize commit SHA case
    - Add/maintain regression tests for idempotent push replay and lease-mapping recovery in publication closures
    - Keep one-shot worker runtime minimal (no long-lived background watcher/watchdog) to avoid EMFILE under repeated inline fallback cycles
  implementation_status:
    completed_in_this_pr:
    - "`apm2 fac push` requires canonical work binding for publication paths and enforces IMPLEMENTER_TERMINAL publication on every push attempt."
    - "`--handoff-note` is optional; HANDOFF_NOTE context publication is conditional while IMPLEMENTER_TERMINAL remains mandatory."
    - "Fast preflight checks (including PR association compatibility) execute before expensive gate execution."
    - "Projection rebuild rejects historical raw protobuf/payload-only work envelopes and requires the canonical session envelope contract."
    - "Review dispatch/runtime joins are fail-closed on missing runtime handles and PID identity mismatches."
    - "`fac review prepare` now bounds inline output (2000-line limit) and returns artifact references/metadata for oversized payloads."
    - "Reviewer subprocess context now carries authoritative PR/head/run identifiers via environment propagation."
    - "Sqlite lease validation now recovers lease->work and executor actor bindings from persisted `work_claims` when legacy claims predate canonical `gate_lease_issued` rows."
    - "Lease fallback is fail-closed on ambiguous `lease_id -> (work_id, actor_id)` mappings and rejects empty bindings."
    - "Work-claim schema now includes `idx_work_claims_lease_id` to keep fallback lookup deterministic and performant."
    - "Work status runtime-binding branch now uses clippy-clean `lease_id.is_empty()` guard ordering (no behavior change)."
    - "Worker claimed-lock handling now retains the lock through terminal queue transition to close TOCTOU re-claim races."
    - "`work.pr_associated` tuple uniqueness now normalizes commit SHA case via case-insensitive partial unique indexes for both legacy and canonical sqlite event tables."
    - "Gates/warm pipeline-commit failures now stay fail-closed in `claimed/` for reconcile recovery (no authority-token requeue replay loops)."
    - "One-shot worker cycles (`run_fac_worker(..., once=true)`) now skip queue watcher and watchdog thread startup, preventing in-process thread/inotify accumulation during inline `fac push` fallback."
  remaining_focus:
    - "Closure protocol: run `apm2 fac push` against active branch and iterate on reviewer findings until merge."

  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids: []
    criteria:
    - '`apm2 fac push` binds changeset publication to an authoritative `work_id` and records required terminal markers.'
    - Terminal closure semantics are enforceable from ledger+CAS alone (IMPLEMENTER_TERMINAL required, HANDOFF_NOTE optional).
    - Projection-backed work identity recovery no longer fails on extension fields in current session envelopes.
    - CLI does not emit work transitions; CI/system actors remain the only sources of CI transitions.
    - Queue terminal transitions are serialized by retaining the claimed lock until transition commit completion.
    - One-shot inline worker fallback cannot leak long-lived watcher/watchdog runtime primitives across retries.
    - PR association idempotency is robust to commit SHA case variants in both legacy and canonical ledger storage.
  notes:
    verification: Add a smoke test script that runs fac push on a dummy repo and confirms evidence markers exist via doctor/projection query.
