  root_cause_analysis:
    summary: |
      Three compounding bugs in the post-admission merge path:

      BUG 1: Main branch gets dirty after merge.
        Location: lifecycle.rs:2058-2085 (sync_main_worktree_if_present)
        Cause: After try_fast_forward_main() updates refs/heads/main via
        git update-ref, the worktree sync only runs `git reset --hard HEAD`
        which handles tracked files but leaves untracked files from the
        feature branch work. git_worktree_has_tracked_changes() uses
        --untracked-files=no so untracked artifacts accumulate. Additionally,
        no cleanup of the feature branch ref or its worktree happens post-merge.

      BUG 2: PR/Admission Request status not updated post-merge.
        Location: lifecycle.rs:2289-2321 (maybe_auto_merge_if_ready_inner success path)
        Cause: After successful local fast-forward + push to origin, the code
        only records a local Merged lifecycle event. No GitHub API call closes
        the PR, deletes the remote branch, or updates the PR body. The system
        relies on GitHub detecting the fast-forward push to auto-close the PR,
        which is GitHub-dependent and not guaranteed.

      BUG 3: GitHub still used as source of truth for merge state.
        Location: lifecycle.rs:2087-2132 (sync_local_main_with_origin),
                  push.rs:1909 (enable_auto_merge),
                  CLAUDE.md ("GitHub is temporarily authoritative for merges")
        Cause: Two competing merge paths exist:
        (a) Local fast-forward merge triggered by maybe_auto_merge_if_ready()
            when both security + code-quality verdicts are approve.
        (b) GitHub auto-merge enabled during fac push via enable_auto_merge()
            which lets GitHub merge independently when status checks pass.
        Either can fire first, creating race conditions. The CLI merge path
        produces no signed MergeReceipt (the daemon MergeExecutor does, but
        is not wired into the CLI path). sync_local_main_with_origin() treats
        origin/main as authoritative, not local state.

scope:
  in_scope:
    - id: "S1_CLEAN_WORKTREE_POST_MERGE"
      title: "Clean worktree after merge (tracked + untracked)"
      detail: |
        After successful fast-forward merge of a feature branch:
        - Run `git clean -fd` (or equivalent) on the main worktree to remove
          untracked files left by the feature branch work.
        - Delete the local feature branch ref.
        - Remove or detach the feature branch worktree if it exists.
        - Clean up any stale worktree target/ directories.
        Ensures main is always clean after admission without manual intervention.

    - id: "S2_PROJECT_MERGE_TO_GITHUB"
      title: "Project merge state to GitHub post-merge"
      detail: |
        After successful local merge + push to origin:
        - Close the PR via GitHub API if not auto-closed by fast-forward detection.
        - Delete the remote feature branch.
        - Update PR body with merge evidence (merge commit SHA, timestamp, receipt).
        - Post a final commit status update reflecting merged state.
        All of these are projections (best-effort, non-authoritative). Local
        lifecycle Merged event remains the source of truth.

    - id: "S3_REMOVE_GITHUB_AUTO_MERGE"
      title: "Stop enabling GitHub auto-merge during fac push"
      detail: |
        Remove the call to enable_auto_merge() in the push flow. The local
        maybe_auto_merge_if_ready() path is the authoritative merge trigger.
        GitHub auto-merge creates a competing merge path and race condition.
        With strict_required_status_checks_policy=true (TCK-00616), the PR
        cannot merge via GitHub until FAC status is posted anyway, so GitHub
        auto-merge adds no value and adds risk.

    - id: "S4_SIGNED_MERGE_RECEIPT"
      title: "Emit signed MergeReceipt on CLI merge path"
      detail: |
        The daemon MergeExecutor already produces signed MergeReceipts.
        The CLI maybe_auto_merge_if_ready_inner() path does not.
        Add MergeReceipt emission to the CLI path:
        - Bind receipt to gate evidence hashes, verdict hashes, and merge commit SHA.
        - Sign with broker/operator key.
        - Persist to receipts store.
        This makes the merge cryptographically attested, not just a raw git operation.

    - id: "S5_LOCAL_AUTHORITATIVE_MERGE_STATE"
      title: "Make local lifecycle state authoritative for merge (remove origin dependency)"
      detail: |
        sync_local_main_with_origin() currently treats origin/main as
        authoritative. Invert this:
        - Local lifecycle Merged event + signed receipt = authoritative merge.
        - Origin is a projection target, not a source of truth.
        - If origin/main has diverged unexpectedly, fail-closed and surface
          the conflict rather than silently accepting origin state.
        - Remove "GitHub is temporarily authoritative for merges" from CLAUDE.md
          once this lands.

    - id: "S6_REGRESSION_TESTS"
      title: "Regression tests for merge flow"
      detail: |
        - Test: worktree is clean (no untracked files) after merge.
        - Test: feature branch ref deleted after merge.
        - Test: GitHub auto-merge is NOT enabled during push.
        - Test: MergeReceipt is emitted and verifiable after CLI merge.
        - Test: origin divergence triggers fail-closed, not silent acceptance.
        - Test: PR is closed/updated via projection after merge.

  out_of_scope:
    - "Redesigning the daemon MergeExecutor or wiring it into the CLI path (future unification)."
    - "Multi-repo or distributed merge coordination."
    - "Changing the verdict state machine (security + code-quality approve = MergeReady)."

  steps:
    - id: "STEP_01"
      title: "Fix worktree cleanup post-merge"
      detail: |
        In sync_main_worktree_if_present(): add git clean -fd after
        git reset --hard HEAD. Add feature branch ref deletion and
        worktree removal/detach logic.
    - id: "STEP_02"
      title: "Add post-merge GitHub projection"
      detail: |
        After Merged lifecycle event: close PR, delete remote branch,
        update PR body, post final status. All best-effort projection.
    - id: "STEP_03"
      title: "Remove enable_auto_merge() from fac push"
      detail: |
        Delete the call in push.rs:1909. Local merge path is authoritative.
    - id: "STEP_04"
      title: "Add signed MergeReceipt to CLI merge path"
      detail: |
        Emit MergeReceipt binding gate evidence, verdicts, and merge commit.
        Sign with broker/operator key. Persist to receipts store.
    - id: "STEP_05"
      title: "Invert origin/main authority"
      detail: |
        Make sync_local_main_with_origin() fail-closed on unexpected divergence
        instead of accepting origin state. Local Merged event is authoritative.
    - id: "STEP_06"
      title: "Add regression tests"
      detail: |
        Clean worktree, branch cleanup, no auto-merge, receipt emission,
        origin divergence fail-closed, PR projection.

notes:
  context: |
    The merge path in the CLI (lifecycle.rs maybe_auto_merge_if_ready_inner)
    currently does a local git fast-forward + push to origin, but:
    - Leaves untracked files in the main worktree
    - Does not close or update the PR on GitHub
    - Does not delete the remote feature branch
    - Does not emit a signed MergeReceipt
    - Races with GitHub auto-merge (enabled during fac push)
    - Treats origin/main as authoritative via sync_local_main_with_origin()

    The daemon-side MergeExecutor (gate/merge_executor.rs) has the right
    design (signed receipts, event emission, policy validation) but is not
    wired into the CLI lifecycle path. This ticket fixes the CLI path
    directly; unifying with the daemon executor is future work.
  security: "default-deny, fail-closed on origin divergence, signed merge receipts"
