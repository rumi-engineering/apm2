  "context": {
    "motivation": "The worker orchestration logic is spread across a very large file with many intertwined concerns\n(scan lock, admission, claim, lane acquisition, warm execution, gate execution, receipts, reconcile\nhooks, watchdog/heartbeat). This increases the probability of brittle behavior and makes it hard\nto reason about crash recovery and invariants.\n",
    "code_evidence": [
      "crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_worker.rs is >8k LOC and mixes queue I/O, lane logic, execution, and recovery.",
      "Several failure paths intentionally leave partially transitioned state (claimed without receipt) and rely on runtime claimed reconcile + startup/doctor convergence."
    ]
  },
  "problem_statement": "Reliability work keeps accumulating as local patches inside fac_worker.rs. Without a clearer\norchestration model (explicit states + transitions + persisted checkpoints), we will keep\nreintroducing edge-case bugs (stuck claimed, corrupt lanes, inconsistent cleanup) as the feature\nset expands (FESv1 subprocess spawning, cgroup containment, multi-worker scaling).\n",
  "proposed_change": {
    "intent": "Refactor the worker into a small set of modules with an explicit state machine that:\n  - makes the allowed transitions explicit\n  - centralizes error handling + classification\n  - surfaces where durable state is written (and what crash recovery expects)\n  - enables targeted unit tests per transition\n"
