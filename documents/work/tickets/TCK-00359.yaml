      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement cache model where one verified head amortizes many identity checks
    - Implement invalidation on revocation, rotation, and head advancement
    - Publish deterministic cache-safety tests and stale-cache negatives
    out_of_scope:
    - CRDT convergence law implementation (TCK-00360)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement cache model where one verified head amortizes many identity
      checks'
    - 'Implement: Implement invalidation on revocation, rotation, and head advancement'
    - 'Implement: Publish deterministic cache-safety tests and stale-cache negatives'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0013
    - EVID-0304
    criteria:
    - Cache reuse measurably reduces repeated verification cost
    - Stale cache entries cannot authorize revoked identities
    - Invalidation path is deterministic and auditable
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
