This means send_input()\nand terminate() both return \"not yet implemented\" errors.\n\nThis is a foundational blocker: without real handle storage, the daemon cannot interact with or lifecycle-manage\nany spawned agent process. Every downstream ticket (adapter wiring, Codex adapter, model selection) depends on\nhandles actually working.\n\nAAT evidence (documents/aat/FINDINGS.md) confirmed that SpawnEpisode succeeds at the IPC\nlayer but no agent process is actually spawned or managed.\n",

      "security": "- HarnessHandle must not expose raw file descriptors across async boundaries without proper ownership semantics.\n- terminate() must guarantee the child process is dead before returning (no zombie processes).\n- stdin writer must be dropped on terminate to prevent writes to dead processes.\n- Child PID must be validated before signal delivery (prevent PID reuse attacks on long-lived daemons).\n"
