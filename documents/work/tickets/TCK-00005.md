# Ticket: TCK-00005 — Implement session lifecycle state machine

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00005
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Define session states (Starting, Running, Terminating, Terminated)
- Implement state transitions
- Emit SessionStarted, SessionTerminated events
- Track session metadata

Out of scope:
- Entropy budget (TCK-00006)
- Crash detection (TCK-00007)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0013
- REQ-0018
- REQ-1002

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0006

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0006

Criteria:
- Session state machine implemented
- State transitions emit correct events
- Actor identity persists across restarts
- Session metadata tracked correctly
- Unit tests for all state transitions

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
