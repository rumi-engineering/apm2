    "primary_cause": "LaneLeaseV1 stores only a PID and the system uses kill(0) to test liveness. PID reuse yields\nfalse positives; the reconcile logic then fail-closes by marking Corrupt and treating the job as\nactive, which can strand work indefinitely.\n",

    "tertiary_cause": "Transient systemd units bind unconditionally to an auto-detected parent unit (session-*.scope from\n/proc/self/cgroup). These session scopes are ephemeral and may be gone/closing by the time\nsystemd-run executes. No existence or stability check is performed on the parent, and there is no\nfallback path when PartOf=/BindsTo= targets a non-existent unit. The failure is intermittent because\nit depends on process cgroup/session lifecycle, not repo code content.\n"
