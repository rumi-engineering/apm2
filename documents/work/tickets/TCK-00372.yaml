      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Build perf harness for 10^6 and 10^8 measured scales with 10^12 projection model
    - Enforce <1% p99 CPU/network overhead gate for batched paths
    - Implement automatic fallback to direct verification on degradation/failure
    out_of_scope:
    - Relay hardening and federation rollout (TCK-00380+)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Build perf harness for 10^6 and 10^8 measured scales with 10^12
      projection model'
    - 'Implement: Enforce <1% p99 CPU/network overhead gate for batched paths'
    - 'Implement: Implement automatic fallback to direct verification on degradation/failure'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0026
    - EVID-0306
    criteria:
    - Overhead measurements captured and within gate budgets
    - Fallback path activates automatically on integrity/freshness/perf failure
    - Fallback behavior preserves acceptance semantics
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
