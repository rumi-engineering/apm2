        "title": "Reap stale singleflight locks via PID-liveness check",
        "detail": "BUG REPORT — observed 2026-02-18, manual remediation required.\n\nSymptoms:\n  - All agents blocked on `fac push` / `fac gates` for 10+ minutes.\n  - 62 stale `.lock` files in `$APM2_HOME/private/fac/queue/singleflight/`,\n    accumulated over ~16 hours (2026-02-17 22:04 → 2026-02-18 14:28).\n  - `fuser` and `lsof` confirmed ZERO processes held any of these locks.\n  - `queue/pending/` and `queue/claimed/` both empty.\n  - 22+ `fac worker` processes sleeping at 0% CPU with nothing to process.\n  - Manual `rm *.lock` in the singleflight directory immediately unblocked\n    all gates processing.\n\nRoot cause:\n  `acquire_gates_single_flight_lock()` in gates.rs:504-560 creates a lock\n  file per (repo_id, head_sha) and acquires an exclusive flock via\n  `lock_exclusive()`. The flock is held for the entire\n  `PreparedGatesRequest` lifetime (`_single_flight_lock` field).\n\n  The mechanism has two compounding defects:\n\n  1. LOCK FILES ARE NEVER CLEANED UP. When the owning process exits\n     (normally or via crash), the OS releases the flock but the file\n     persists. Over time the directory accumulates hundreds of stale\n     lock files — one per SHA ever evaluated. There is no reaper, no\n     TTL, and no GC integration.\n\n  2. NO LIVENESS CHECK BEFORE BLOCKING. `lock_exclusive()` blocks\n     indefinitely if another process holds the flock. Under memory\n     pressure (swap thrashing), a flock-holding process may be\n     effectively hung — unable to make progress to release the lock.\n     New callers for the same SHA pile up blocked on flock, consuming\n     resources and worsening the pressure. There is no timeout on the\n     flock acquisition.\n\n  Compounding factor: the incident co-occurred with 15 GB of stale\n  build artifacts in `/dev/shm/apm2-target` (RAM-backed tmpfs),\n  which exhausted swap (3 GB/3 GB) and caused system-wide thrash.\n  Under thrash, flock-holding processes could not make progress,\n  creating a feedback loop where lock waiters accumulated faster\n  than locks were released.\n\nRequired fix (PREP phase integration):\n  1. Before calling `lock_exclusive()`, attempt `try_lock_exclusive()`.\n     If the lock is held, check whether the holding PID is alive\n     (write PID to lock file content; verify with `kill(pid, 0)`).\n     If PID is dead, reap the lock file and re-acquire.\n  2. Add a configurable timeout to flock acquisition (default: 120s).\n     On timeout, emit a diagnostic event and fail with actionable\n     error (\"stale singleflight lock for SHA <x>, owning PID <y>\n     is dead/unresponsive — run `apm2 fac gc` or remove lock\").\n  3. PREP phase (S1) MUST reap stale singleflight locks as a\n     readiness step: scan the directory, check PID liveness for\n     each lock, remove files whose owners are dead.\n  4. Emit a prep_step event for singleflight reaping with count of\n     reaped locks.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n  - Stale singleflight locks (owner PID dead) are automatically\n    reaped during PREP phase.\n  - `lock_exclusive()` never blocks indefinitely; bounded by timeout.\n  - Lock files include owning PID for liveness verification.\n  - Lock reaping emits structured telemetry (prep_step event).\n  - Regression test: simulate process crash mid-lock, verify next\n    gates invocation reaps the stale lock and proceeds.\n\nReferences:\n  - gates.rs:504-560 (acquire_gates_single_flight_lock)\n  - gates.rs:130 (_single_flight_lock field on PreparedGatesRequest)\n  - RFC-0019 FESv1 §4.4 (stale lease handling MUST be fail-closed)\n  - RFC-0019 FESv1 §0.3 (reuse model_pool.rs leasing pattern)\n"
