      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0019 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Remove or hard-disable any remaining legacy allow/bypass paths for tool execution
    - Remove deprecated protocol handlers that are unused by FAC v0
    - Add regression tests ensuring no tool executes without broker mediation
    out_of_scope:
    - xtask deprecation
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep beyond out_of_scope
      list.
    - 'Implement: Remove or hard-disable any remaining legacy allow/bypass paths for tool execution'
    - 'Implement: Remove deprecated protocol handlers that are unused by FAC v0'
    - 'Implement: Add regression tests ensuring no tool executes without broker mediation'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression risks per
      RFC-0019/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding EVID-*
      artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0015
    criteria:
    - No code path allows tool execution without broker mediation + ledger emission
    - Deprecated handlers are deleted or hard-disabled and covered by tests
  notes:
    security: Productivity-first; keep fail-closed invariants intact where already mandated by
      RFC-0019.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests and CAS/ledger replay checks; avoid relying on process
      memory.
    general: Keep changes minimal, explicit, and reversible; make dependencies and attribution
      fields queryable.
