context:
  observed_symptoms:
    - 'Lane lease age warnings are frequently "unknown"; on-call cannot reliably reason about lane lease staleness from logs.'
    - 'Downstream logic that expects RFC3339 cannot safely compute lease age or enforce TTL policies.'
    - 'After TCK-00577, `apm2 fac push` hard-fails in user-mode (local dev) because _apm2-job is not in /etc/passwd — no service user is ever provisioned.'
    - 'Even when _apm2-job exists, fchown(fd, -1, _apm2-job_gid) fails for calling user (ubuntu) because it is not in the group and lacks CAP_CHOWN — broker-mediated path is broken for unprivileged users.'
  code_evidence:
    - |
      LaneLeaseV1 documents started_at as ISO 8601 (RFC3339):
        crates/apm2-core/src/fac/lane.rs (LaneLeaseV1.started_at docstring)
    - |
      Worker writes started_at as epoch seconds string, not RFC3339:
        crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_worker.rs:4415
        started_at = &current_timestamp_epoch_secs().to_string()
    - |
      Worker-side helper expects RFC3339 and returns None on epoch seconds:
        crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_worker.rs:1367-1373 (parse_started_at_age_secs)
    - |
      Service user gate fires unconditionally in check_queue_write_permission regardless of
      execution backend mode; no user-mode bypass path exists:
        crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac.rs (check_queue_write_permission)
    - |
      bootstrap never calls useradd or creates _apm2-job; RFC-0019 assigned this to bootstrap
      but no implementation exists:
        crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac.rs (bootstrap subcommand)

problem_statement: |
  LaneLeaseV1.started_at is semantically specified as an ISO 8601 timestamp, but at least one producer
  writes epoch-seconds as a string. This breaks time-based reasoning and makes any future TTL-based
  reconciliation unreliable (and currently degrades operator visibility). The format mismatch also
  increases the risk of subtle "stale lease" bugs because multiple call-sites make implicit assumptions
  about started_at.

root_cause_analysis:
  primary_cause: |
    The worker uses current_timestamp_epoch_secs().to_string() when persisting leases, while other
    parts of the system expect RFC3339 (ISO 8601). There is no validator in LaneLeaseV1::new to
    enforce the declared format.
  contributing_factors:
    - 'LaneLeaseV1::new validates length but not timestamp format, so invalid started_at is silently accepted.'
    - 'There is no migration/backward-compat parsing path; old leases persist until manual lane reset.'

proposed_change:
  intent: |
    Make LaneLeaseV1.started_at unambiguous and machine-checkable by:
      (1) enforcing RFC3339 on new writes,
      (2) supporting a legacy decode path for epoch-seconds strings to avoid bricking existing lanes,
      (3) centralizing lease age computation in apm2-core (single source of truth).

invariants:
  - id: 'INV-LEASE-TS-001'
    statement: 'All newly persisted LaneLeaseV1.started_at values MUST be RFC3339 timestamps (UTC, offset Z).'
  - id: 'INV-LEASE-TS-002'
    statement: 'LaneLeaseV1::load MUST accept legacy epoch-seconds started_at and expose a canonical RFC3339 view.'
  - id: 'INV-LEASE-TS-003'

        Add a canonical timestamp parser/normalizer in apm2-core:
          - parse RFC3339 (preferred)
          - parse legacy epoch-seconds (u64) and convert to RFC3339
          - expose helpers:
              LaneLeaseV1::started_at_rfc3339() -> Option<String>
              LaneLeaseV1::started_at_epoch_secs() -> Option<u64>
              LaneLeaseV1::age_secs(now_epoch_secs: u64) -> Option<u64>
        This keeps format policy out of the CLI worker.

      description: |
        Enforce started_at format on new writes:
          - Update all LaneLeaseV1::new call-sites to pass RFC3339.
            Known call-sites:
              - crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_worker.rs
              - crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac.rs (lane init / reset helpers)
              - tests that currently pass "t" or other placeholders
    - id: 'S3'
      description: |
        Update any age/TTL logic to use apm2-core helpers:
          - Replace parse_started_at_age_secs in fac_worker.rs with LaneLeaseV1::age_secs.
          - Ensure reconcile warnings/logs show both raw and canonical started_at when legacy detected.
    - id: 'S4'
      description: |
        Add tests:
          - Unit: started_at RFC3339 parse/roundtrip.
          - Unit: legacy epoch-secs parse converts to RFC3339 (stable conversion in UTC).
          - Unit: invalid started_at is rejected by LaneLeaseV1::new OR produces None canonical view.
            (Choose one policy; prefer "reject on persist" but allow load for migration.)
          - Regression: worker lease writes RFC3339.

        Fix user-mode (local dev) regression introduced by TCK-00577:
          - In check_queue_write_permission, detect when the execution backend is UserMode.
          - When UserMode: bypass the service user gate entirely and use UnsafeLocalWrite
            semantics automatically. No env var opt-in, no useradd required.
          - Rationale: in user-mode, worker and CLI both run as the same user (e.g., ubuntu);
            privilege separation is not applicable and the gate is unreachable by design.
          - Scope covers push, gates, and warm enqueue paths (all callers of check_queue_write_permission).

        Implement _apm2-job service user provisioning in bootstrap --system:
          - `apm2 fac bootstrap --system` must:
              * Create _apm2-job system user (useradd -r -s /usr/sbin/nologin _apm2-job) if not present.
              * chown/chgrp the FAC root directories to _apm2-job where required.
              * Add the calling user to the _apm2-job group (usermod -aG _apm2-job $SUDO_USER).
          - Provisioning must be idempotent (safe to re-run).
          - bootstrap --user (local dev mode) MUST NOT attempt provisioning.
  out_of_scope:
    - 'Changing queue/job receipt timestamp formats (handled elsewhere).'
    - 'Introducing TTL-based reclaim policies (separate ticket once timestamps are trustworthy).'
    - 'Full redesign of the broker-mediated ownership transfer path (larger change, system-mode only).'

rollout:
  migration_notes: |
    This change MUST be backward-compatible for reading existing leases, because field values are
    already present on disk. New writes will be RFC3339; old values remain parseable.
  operational_checklist:
    - 'After deploy, run: apm2 fac queue lanes --json | verify started_at is RFC3339 for newly running jobs.'

notes:
  security: |
    Timestamp parsing is not security-sensitive, but impacts reconcile correctness. Fail closed on
    parse errors when reclaim decisions would depend on age.
  risk:
    - 'If LaneLeaseV1::new becomes strict, some tests and any out-of-tree tooling writing leases may break; keep load permissive.'
    - 'Time conversion relies on wall clock; do not introduce reclaim decisions that depend solely on started_at until combined with additional evidence (lock state, process identity, unit liveness).'
