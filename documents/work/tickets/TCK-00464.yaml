        reason: "Deterministic delegation/effect closure builds on lifecycle receipt typing baseline."
  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Implement deterministic `delegation_meet_exact_v1` validation with integer/tick arithmetic only."
      - "Enforce delegation satisfiability, depth bounds, and deny-path obligations for widening/non-computable/vacuous outputs."
      - "Bind consume/effect intent digest equality and single-consume invariants to gate decisions."
      - "Guarantee all authority-bearing actuation paths traverse broker/capability/context-firewall prerequisites."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Economic optimization policy."
      - "Projection sink continuity behavior."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Add meet recomputation and digest equality checks across independent verifier surfaces."
      - "Add satisfiability receipt and depth-budget enforcement to delegation admission."
      - "Instrument no-bypass actuation dependency checks and deny traces."
      - "Add replay/restart tests for duplicate consume and intent mismatch paths."

    evidence_ids:
      - "EVID-0003"
      - "EVID-0004"
    criteria:
      - "Delegation widening attempts deny at all evaluated recursion depths."
      - "Delegation outputs without non-empty admissible workset are non-admissible."
      - "No authoritative side-effect path can bypass mandatory enforcement dependencies."
  notes:
    security: |
      Any mismatch between consumed authority intent and emitted effect intent is a hard deny.
    verification: |
      Include independent recomputation concordance reports and no-bypass path coverage.
    general: |
      This ticket provides the core deterministic authority-composition closure for RFC-0028.
