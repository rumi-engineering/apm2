  notes:
    context: |
      No IPC endpoint exists for publishing a ChangeSetBundle to the daemon. The ChangeSetPublished
      event is tested in hef_fac_v0_e2e.rs and changeset_published_integration.rs but these
      construct it directly in-process. For autonomous operation, an agent completing implementation
      work needs to submit its changeset through the daemon to get it anchored in the ledger with
      a ChangeSetPublished event before gates can run.

      Currently xtask handles this by running `git diff` externally and creating PRs, but the
      daemon FAC pipeline needs a formal PublishChangeSet operator socket message that:
      - Accepts a ChangeSetBundleV1 (file diffs + metadata)
      - Stores it in CAS via DurableCas
      - Emits ChangeSetPublished event to ledger
      - Returns the changeset_digest for subsequent gate lease binding (TCK-00388)

      The ChangeSetBundleV1 (changeset_bundle.rs line 337) contains: changeset_id, base GitObjectRef,
      changeset_digest (computed deterministically), diff_hash, file_manifest (Vec<FileChange>),
      binary_detected flag. The builder (line 557) computes the changeset_digest automatically
      via compute_digest() (line 668).

      The ChangeSetPublished event (line 684) is created via ChangeSetPublished::create() (line 722)
      which signs with CHANGESET_PUBLISHED: domain separator (defined in domain_separator.rs line 128).

      The PrivilegedMessageType enum (dispatch.rs line 1815-1869) currently has tags 1-15, 21-26,
      64, 66, 68. A new tag (e.g., 70) should be used for PublishChangeSet.

      The OperatorClient (crates/apm2-cli/src/client/protocol.rs line 280) already provides methods
      like claim_work, spawn_episode, work_status. Adding publish_changeset follows the same pattern.

      This ticket bridges the gap between "session does work" and "gates can run on the changeset."
      Without it, the autonomous pipeline has no way to anchor a changeset in the ledger.

    security: |
      The ChangeSetPublished event's domain-separated signature (CHANGESET_PUBLISHED: prefix)
      prevents cross-domain replay attacks. The changeset_digest is computed deterministically
      over canonical bundle bytes, ensuring the same inputs always produce the same digest.
      The handler must validate work_id exists and is in a valid state (Claimed or InProgress)
      before accepting a changeset, preventing orphaned changesets. CAS storage provides
      tamper-evident content addressing -- any modification to the stored bundle changes its
      hash, breaking the cas_hash binding in the ledger event. The handler must validate
      the ChangeSetBundleV1 structure (no empty changeset_id, valid base GitObjectRef, at
      least one FileChange in manifest) before storing. Idempotency prevents duplicate
      ChangeSetPublished events which could confuse downstream gate orchestration.
