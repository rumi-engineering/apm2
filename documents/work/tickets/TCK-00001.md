# Ticket: TCK-00001 — Implement ledger storage layer with SQLite WAL

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00001
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Create SQLite database with events table
- Implement append-only write semantics
- Implement cursor-based read
- Enable WAL mode for concurrent reads
- Create artifact_refs table for CAS

Out of scope:
- Hash chaining (TCK-00003)
- Projection tables (TCK-00004)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0006
- REQ-0008
- REQ-1001

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0004

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0004

Criteria:
- SQLite database created with correct schema
- Events can be appended in order
- Events can be read by sequence number or cursor
- WAL mode verified with concurrent read test
- Unit tests for all CRUD operations

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
