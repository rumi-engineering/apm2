  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Wire projection module into daemon
    - Ledger tailer for projection decisions
    - 'Work index: changeset -> work_id -> PR'
    - GitHub adapter for status + comment
    out_of_scope:
    - Projection receipt event (TCK-00323)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep beyond out_of_scope
      list.
    - 'Implement: Wire projection module into daemon'
    - 'Implement: Ledger tailer for projection decisions'
    - 'Implement: Work index: changeset -> work_id -> PR'
    - 'Implement: GitHub adapter for status + comment'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression risks per
      RFC-0019/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding EVID-*
      artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0006
    criteria:
    - Projection worker runs as daemon task
    - ReviewReceiptRecorded triggers GitHub projection
    - Status + comment posted to PR
  notes:
    security: Productivity-first; keep fail-closed invariants intact where already mandated by
      RFC-0019.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests and CAS/ledger replay checks; avoid relying on process
      memory.
    general: Keep changes minimal, explicit, and reversible; make dependencies and attribution
      fields queryable.
