# Ticket: TCK-00004 — Implement reducer framework with checkpointing

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00004
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Define Reducer trait
- Implement checkpoint storage
- Implement incremental event processing
- Create projection tables (active_leases, session_health)
- Property tests for determinism

Out of scope:
- Specific reducers (handled in later tickets)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0007
- REQ-0025
- REQ-1001
- REQ-1003

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0005

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0005

Criteria:
- Reducer trait defined with apply method
- Checkpoints stored and loaded correctly
- Incremental processing from checkpoint works
- Property tests verify determinism
- Replay from genesis produces same projection

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
