    summary: |
      Test gates that previously completed in ~120s are now taking over
      10 minutes, blocking all work from getting through the pipeline.

      INVESTIGATION REQUIRED: Identify multiple theories and performance-
      profile tests that may be consuming untoward resources, or any
      recent changes to the bounded test running logic that could have
      caused this regression.

      Theories to investigate:
        1. Recent changes to bounded test runner logic (gate execution,
           timeout handling, parallelism limits)
        2. Test compilation time regression (incremental build cache
           invalidation, new heavy dependencies)
        3. Resource contention (lock contention, file I/O bottleneck,
           lane/worktree locking changes)
        4. Gate orchestration overhead (poll loop inefficiency, redundant
           gate re-execution, state machine thrashing)
        5. New test additions or test scope expansion inflating total
           execution time
        6. Crash recovery reconciliation (TCK-00534) introducing
           overhead on every gate cycle

notes:
  context: |
    Reported by operator: test gates that used to complete in ~120s are
    now taking over 10 minutes, with no work getting through the
    pipeline. This is a critical throughput regression affecting all
    PR processing.

    Investigation request (verbatim):
    "There's something deeply wrong with our test gates -- it used to
    take just ~120s to execute gates but now gates are taking over 10
    minutes and no work is getting through. Please investigate and
    identify what could be causing this. Since this is a tricky issue,
    identify multiple theories and performance profile tests that may
    be consuming untoward resources or any recent changes to the bounded
    test running logic that could have caused this."
