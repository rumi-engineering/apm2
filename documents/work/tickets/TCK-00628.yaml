root_cause_analysis:
  summary: |
    The usability guarantees established in REQ-0031 through REQ-0038 have no
    formal automated test coverage that exercises the complete end-to-end paths.
    Without a conformance suite, regressions in zero-touch bootstrap, offline
    operation, failure normalization, or warm-path performance can ship silently.
    The four conformance scenarios are the machine-verifiable evidence that all
    usability requirements are met simultaneously.

    - id: "S1_SCENARIO_A"
      title: "Scenario A: zero-touch fresh worktree with network available"
      detail: |
        Test setup:
          - Create a temp dir as APM2_HOME (empty)
          - Provide a valid FAC config pointing to a test repo
          - Network available
        Test action: run `apm2 fac push --json` (gates executes as a phase)
        Assertions:
          - exit code 0
          - prep_autofix events emitted (ReadinessController auto-healed)
          - all gates run (gate_count > 0)
          - run_summary.phase_failed is null
    - id: "S2_SCENARIO_B"
      title: "Scenario B: offline run with pre-seeded closure"
      detail: |
        Test setup:
          - Pre-populated APM2_HOME with valid substrate and signed closure
          - Network denied for EXECUTE (via test fixture)
        Test action: run `apm2 fac push --json` (gates phase runs within push)
        Assertions:
          - exit code 0
          - execute_started event includes network_policy confirming denial
          - all gates run using pre-seeded closure entries
          - run_summary.phase_failed is null
    - id: "S3_SCENARIO_C"
      title: "Scenario C: offline run without closure"
      detail: |
        Test setup:
          - Pre-populated APM2_HOME substrate but no closure artifact
          - Network denied (both PREP and EXECUTE)
        Test action: run `apm2 fac push --json` (gates phase runs within push)
        Assertions:
          - exit code non-zero
          - run_failed event emitted with failure_code=PREP_SUPPLY_UNAVAILABLE
          - no gate_started events emitted (zero gates ran)
          - remediation field is non-empty and actionable
    - id: "S4_SCENARIO_D"
      title: "Scenario D: warm-path run (identical second execution)"
      detail: |
        Test setup:
          - run1: completed successfully, cache populated
        Test action: run `apm2 fac push --json` again (same SHA, same closure)
        Assertions:
          - exit code 0
          - run_summary.is_warm_run = true
          - run_summary.cache_hit_count == gate_count
          - run_summary.total_duration_ms <= run1.total_duration_ms * 0.20
    - id: "S5_CI_GATE"
      title: "Register all four scenarios as promotion-blocking CI tests"
      detail: |
        Add all four scenarios to the CI test suite in a dedicated
        conformance test module. Mark them as blocking for RFC-0019
        promotion gate. They must pass before any RFC-0019 quality gate
        can be closed.
  out_of_scope:
    - "Testing individual component behaviors (each is covered by its own ticket's tests)."
    - "Performance benchmarking beyond Scenario D's SLO assertion."
    - "macOS or Windows conformance (Linux only for now)."

  steps:
    - id: "STEP_01"
      title: "Create conformance test module and fixture helpers"
      detail: |
        New test module: tests/fac_gates_conformance.rs (or similar).
        Helpers: temp_apm2_home(), pre_seeded_closure_fixture(), deny_network_fixture().
        Each helper is reusable across scenarios.
    - id: "STEP_02"
      title: "Implement Scenario A (zero-touch fresh worktree)"
      detail: |
        Use temp_apm2_home(). Run gates. Parse JSONL. Assert exit 0,
        prep_autofix events, gate count > 0, phase_failed null.
    - id: "STEP_03"
      title: "Implement Scenario B (offline with pre-seeded closure)"
      detail: |
        Use pre_seeded_closure_fixture() + deny_network_fixture() for EXECUTE.
        Run gates. Assert exit 0, network_policy in execute_started, phase_failed null.
    - id: "STEP_04"
      title: "Implement Scenario C (offline without closure)"
      detail: |
        Use APM2_HOME with substrate but no closure. deny_network_fixture().
        Run gates. Assert exit non-zero, run_failed with PREP_SUPPLY_UNAVAILABLE,
        no gate_started events.
    - id: "STEP_05"
      title: "Implement Scenario D (warm-path run)"
      detail: |
        Run gates twice. Capture run_summary from both. Assert is_warm_run=true,
        cache_hit_count == gate_count, duration SLO met.
    - id: "STEP_06"
      title: "Register scenarios as promotion-blocking and run workspace validation"
      detail: |
        Add #[cfg(feature = "conformance")] or CI-only test gate annotation.
        cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
        cargo doc --workspace --no-deps && cargo test --workspace

notes:
  context: |
    This is the final ticket in the REQ-0031..REQ-0039 cluster and depends on
    all preceding tickets. It is purely a test-authoring ticket: no new
    production code is written here. All four scenarios exercise production
    code paths through their public command interfaces. The conformance suite
    is the official evidence artifact for the RFC-0019 quality gate closure
    covering the usability cluster.
  security: "conformance tests use isolated temp dirs; no real credentials or keys"
