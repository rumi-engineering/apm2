# Ticket: TCK-00017 — Implement work contract data model

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00017
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Define Work struct with states
- Implement WorkOpened, WorkTransitioned events
- Spec snapshot handling
- Requirement binding

Out of scope:
- Lease integration (TCK-00018)
- Evidence publication (TCK-00019)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0001
- REQ-0003
- REQ-0014

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0001

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0001

Criteria:
- Work states defined (OPEN, CLAIMED, IN_PROGRESS, REVIEW, NEEDS_INPUT, COMPLETED, ABORTED)
- WorkOpened includes spec_snapshot_hash
- State transitions validated
- Work projection tracks all active work
- Requirement IDs linked to work

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
