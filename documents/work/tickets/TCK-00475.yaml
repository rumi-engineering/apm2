  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Require KPI/countermetric completeness for all optimization decisions."
      - "Enforce canonical TemporalPredicateEvaluatorV1 and arbitration bindings for TP-EIO29 predicates."
      - "Enforce evidence-quality thresholds (power >= 0.90, alpha <= 0.01, sample-size proof) and reproducibility matrix (>=3 runtime classes)."
      - "Enforce freshness BLOCKED transitions and throughput-dominance behavior for promotion-critical evidence classes."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Disclosure policy mode design changes."
      - "Projection sink continuity scenario orchestration."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Bind countermetric.profile and receipt.run checks into optimization gate path."
      - "Implement fail-closed defects for missing KPI/countermetric and unresolved arbitration states."
      - "Implement quality/freshness/throughput gate checks in promotion-critical policy path."
      - "Add deterministic tests for threshold failures, stale evidence, and throughput-dominance violations."
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
      - "EVID-0006"
    criteria:
      - "Optimization gates reject incomplete KPI/countermetric mappings."
      - "Evidence-quality gate enforces statistical thresholds and reproducibility matrix contracts."
      - "Stale or throughput-dominance-violating evidence classes block optimization promotions."
  notes:
    security: |
      Countermetric incompleteness and low-confidence evidence are non-admissible for promotion-critical optimization.
    verification: |
      Include evaluator disagreement/arbitration fixtures and quality-threshold deny suites.
    general: |
      This ticket implements REQ-0006 interlock and quantitative evidence-governance enforcement.
