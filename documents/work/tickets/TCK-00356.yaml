      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement HolonDirectoryHeadV1, IdentityProofV1, and DirectoryProofV1
    - Require proof-carrying pointers for identity-bearing boundary messages
    - Bind directory head to authority seals and freshness policy references
    out_of_scope:
    - Proof-profile economics and caching policy (TCK-00358, TCK-00359)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement HolonDirectoryHeadV1, IdentityProofV1, and DirectoryProofV1'
    - 'Implement: Require proof-carrying pointers for identity-bearing boundary messages'
    - 'Implement: Bind directory head to authority seals and freshness policy references'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0010
    - EVID-0303
    criteria:
    - Identity-bearing messages include identity_proof_hash pointers
    - Directory head hashes resolve to signed/authenticated head artifacts
    - Unproofed identity values rejected for authoritative operations
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
