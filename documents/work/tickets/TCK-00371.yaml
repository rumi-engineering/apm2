      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement BatchEpochRootV1 root-of-roots commitments
    - Add epoch-level anti-entropy pointers for large-scale traversal
    - Maintain bounded verifier work for deep batch histories
    out_of_scope:
    - Overhead gate enforcement harness (TCK-00372)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement BatchEpochRootV1 root-of-roots commitments'
    - 'Implement: Add epoch-level anti-entropy pointers for large-scale traversal'
    - 'Implement: Maintain bounded verifier work for deep batch histories'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0025
    - EVID-0306
    criteria:
    - Hierarchical roots are deterministic and content-addressed
    - Verifier can traverse root-of-roots with bounded memory
    - Anti-entropy advertisements can reference epoch roots directly
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
