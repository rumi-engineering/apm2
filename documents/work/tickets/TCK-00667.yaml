root_cause_analysis:
  summary: |
    fac_review currently orchestrates reviewer runs by spawning detached systemd units,
    tracking PIDs in review_state.json, and inferring liveness from PID existence + pulse
    files. This causes multiple classes of brittleness:

      - PID reuse / dead PID ambiguity causes 'alive' false positives.
      - Orchestrator crashes leave stale state that blocks progress.
      - Multiple sources of truth (state.json, pulse files, GitHub) diverge.
      - The orchestration does not naturally compose with daemon-side work/lease/session
        logic introduced by RFC-0032.

    The kernel-native direction is: CLI requests dispatch; daemon owns execution and
    durability; CLI observes progress via pulses/projections.

      title: "Replace systemd-run detached dispatch with daemon DispatchReviewer"
      detail: |
        Update CLI review dispatch paths to call the daemon DispatchReviewer RPC instead of
        any detached local wrapper orchestration.

        Requirements:
          - dispatch must be idempotent (stable dispatch_idempotency_key derived from work_id + head_sha + review_kind + attempt)
          - daemon returns a session_id / run_id that CLI can observe via pulses/projection
          - CLI retains an operator-friendly output that links to work_id/session_id

    - id: "DRP-002"
      title: "Replace PID/pulse-file liveness with pulse subscriptions + status projection"
      detail: |
        For wait/resume/doctor decision flows:
          - use SubscribePulse/WaitForPulse to wait on reviewer terminal topics
          - use GetReviewStatus (or WorkStatus extension) to decide whether a reviewer is pending/alive/done/blocked
          - eliminate the need to read review_state.json or check /proc for liveness

        Local pulse files may remain temporarily as derived UX, but must not be used to make authority decisions.

    - id: "DRP-003"
      title: "Route PR-scoped remediation through doctor --pr --fix using lease/session signals"
      detail: |
        Replace local timestamp/PID restart heuristics with:
          - lease expiry / renewal signals
          - session termination reasons recorded by daemon
          - WorkLoopManager reaper outputs (RFC-0032 Phase 4)

        Ensure `apm2 fac doctor --pr <N> --fix` remains bounded and does not attempt reviewer
        restart when a session is still legitimately running.

    - id: "DRP-004"
      title: "Hard-cut legacy review orchestration command surfaces"
      detail: |
        Ensure legacy command surfaces are fully removed and not reintroduced:
          - `apm2 fac review run`
          - `apm2 fac review restart`
          - `apm2 fac restart`

        Remediation and follow-up behavior must be expressed via doctor-first flows
        (`apm2 fac doctor --fix` and `apm2 fac doctor --pr <N> --fix`) with daemon authority.

  out_of_scope:
    - Rewriting reviewer model backends (Codex/Gemini/Claude) beyond what is necessary to run under daemon-owned episodes.
    - Removing all GitHub caching immediately.

plan:
  steps:
    - Implement dispatch call path and output formatting (work_id + session/run id).
    - Implement wait path using pulses and projection query.
    - Convert PR-scoped doctor remediation decisions to lease/session signals.
    - Add integration test: CLI crash mid-wait and resume still succeeds.
    - Add integration test: duplicate dispatch requests do not spawn duplicate sessions.

definition_of_done:
  criteria:
    - "CLI review orchestration does not depend on systemd-run detached dispatch for correctness."
    - "CLI liveness and wait behavior uses pulse subscriptions + daemon projection, not PID/pulse-file inference."
    - "Doctor PR-scoped remediation decisions are lease/session-driven and idempotent."
    - "Legacy review run/restart command surfaces remain removed."
    - "Integration tests cover crash/resume and duplicate-dispatch idempotency."

risks:
  - id: "R-DRP-01"
    title: "Operator workflows rely on existing review_state.json artifacts"
    mitigation: |
      Provide derived/compat output (read-only) for a transition period, but keep it non-authoritative.
      Document that the canonical truth is now daemon projections.
