      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0019 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Introduce taint classification for untrusted inputs (diffs, tool outputs, web content)
    - Define policies for what tainted content can flow into high-authority prompts/receipts
    - Emit PolicyViolation or ReviewBlockedRecorded on forbidden taint flows
    out_of_scope:
    - Formal proof of non-interference
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep beyond out_of_scope
      list.
    - 'Implement: Introduce taint classification for untrusted inputs (diffs, tool outputs, web
      content)'
    - 'Implement: Define policies for what tainted content can flow into high-authority prompts/receipts'
    - 'Implement: Emit PolicyViolation or ReviewBlockedRecorded on forbidden taint flows'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression risks per
      RFC-0019/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding EVID-*
      artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0016
    criteria:
    - Taint tags propagate through evidence pointers and context compilation
    - Forbidden taint flows are denied and recorded
  notes:
    security: Productivity-first; keep fail-closed invariants intact where already mandated by
      RFC-0019.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests and CAS/ledger replay checks; avoid relying on process
      memory.
    general: Keep changes minimal, explicit, and reversible; make dependencies and attribution
      fields queryable.
