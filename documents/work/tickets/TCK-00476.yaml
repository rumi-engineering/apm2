        reason: "Disclosure interlocks depend on baseline optimization gate and evidence-quality enforcement behavior."
  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Bind optimization decisions to signed disclosure-control policy snapshots and epochs."
      - "Enforce phase-qualified disclosure policy mode matching for evaluated windows."
      - "Deny patent/provisional and unapproved disclosure channels in TRADE_SECRET_ONLY mode."
      - "Fail closed on unknown, stale, missing, or ambiguous disclosure-control state."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Future patent-allowing policy mode design."
      - "Non-authoritative informational telemetry surfaces."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Wire trade.secret.policy profile checks into optimization gate path."
      - "Add policy epoch freshness/signature checks and phase-mode validation."
      - "Implement structured deny traces for prohibited disclosure channels."
      - "Add policy transition negatives for stale/unsigned/ambiguous updates."
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
      - "EVID-0007"
    criteria:
      - "Disclosure policy mode mismatch is non-admissible."
      - "Trade-secret mode denies patent/provisional workflows by default."
      - "Disclosure-policy ambiguity fails closed."
  notes:
    security: |
      Disclosure-control posture changes must never relax containment guarantees.
    verification: |
      Include phase-mode mismatch and stale-policy deny fixtures.
    general: |
      This ticket operationalizes REQ-0007 disclosure controls as hard optimization admission constraints.
