# Ticket: TCK-00020 — Implement gate receipt generator

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00020
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Generate GateReceipt from evidence
- Auto-populate from harness data
- Emit GateReceiptGenerated event
- Validate evidence completeness

Out of scope:
- Gate review UI (CLI only)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0016
- REQ-0031
- REQ-0032
- REQ-0038

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0016

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0016

Criteria:
- Gate receipt generated from evidence bundle
- 80-95% of receipt auto-populated
- PASS/FAIL result computed
- Receipt signed
- Work blocked if evidence incomplete

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
