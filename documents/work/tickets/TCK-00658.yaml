context:
  observed_symptoms:
    - 'Lanes marked Corrupt and jobs remain stuck in claimed because the lease PID appears alive even though the original worker is gone.'
    - 'Operators report dead-PID situations; recovery often requires manual lane reset and/or queue surgery.'
    - 'Orphaned claimed jobs with consumed channel_context_token are requeued by startup reconcile, then denied at replay by nonce check — job is permanently stuck rather than cleanly failed.'
  code_evidence:
    - |
      Lane liveness uses kill(pid, 0) only (PID existence), which is vulnerable to PID reuse:
        crates/apm2-core/src/fac/lane.rs:3030-3078 (derive_lane_state + is_pid_alive)
    - |
      Reconcile treats "lock free + pid alive" as Corrupt and then considers the job active,
      preventing claimed→pending recovery:
        crates/apm2-core/src/fac/reconcile.rs:769-817
    - |
      Lane reset kill path only checks /proc/<pid>/comm exists before SIGTERM/SIGKILL,
      which can kill the wrong process under PID reuse:
        crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac.rs:5124-5171
    - |
      Token nonce is consumed before job completes; reconcile requeues orphaned claimed
      jobs unconditionally (OrphanedJobPolicy::Requeue), violating single-use semantics:
        crates/apm2-core/src/fac/token_ledger.rs:567 (nonce marked consumed)
        crates/apm2-cli/src/commands/fac_worker.rs:772 (OrphanedJobPolicy::Requeue at startup)
        crates/apm2-core/src/fac/reconcile.rs:1418 (requeue without token-awareness)
        crates/apm2-core/src/fac/token_ledger.rs:657 (replay denial on second execution)

problem_statement: |
  PID existence is an insufficient identity for lane ownership. Linux PID reuse can cause the system
  to believe a dead lease is still alive, producing Corrupt lanes and preventing requeue of claimed
  jobs. This is both a liveness failure (jobs stuck) and a safety risk (potentially killing unrelated
  processes via operator tools).

root_cause_analysis:
  primary_cause: |
    LaneLeaseV1 stores only a PID and the system uses kill(0) to test liveness. PID reuse yields
    false positives; the reconcile logic then fail-closes by marking Corrupt and treating the job as
    active, which can strand work indefinitely.
  secondary_cause: |
    There is no durable process-identity binding (e.g., /proc/<pid>/stat starttime) in LaneLeaseV1.

proposed_change:
  intent: |
    Bind lane leases to process identity by recording the process start time (in kernel ticks since
    boot) at lease creation and verifying it during liveness checks. This makes PID reuse detectable
    and allows safe, automatic recovery from stale leases without killing unrelated processes.

invariants:
  - id: 'INV-PROC-ID-001'
    statement: 'If a LaneLeaseV1 contains pid + proc_start_time_ticks, the lane is considered owned by that process IFF (kill(pid,0) == alive) AND (/proc/<pid>/stat starttime == proc_start_time_ticks).'
  - id: 'INV-PROC-ID-002'
    statement: 'If PID is alive but starttime mismatches, it MUST be treated as NOT the lease owner (PID reuse or identity loss).'
  - id: 'INV-PROC-ID-003'
    statement: 'Reconcile MUST NOT strand claimed jobs solely due to PID existence; it must use identity checks or additional evidence.'
  - id: 'INV-TOKEN-REQUEUE-001'

  - id: 'INV-TOKEN-REQUEUE-002'
    statement: 'OrphanedJobPolicy::Requeue is only valid for explicitly idempotent or token-free jobs; token-bound jobs MUST use OrphanedJobPolicy::Fail.'

        Extend LaneLeaseV1 with process identity:
          - Add field: proc_start_time_ticks: optional u64
          - Record this value at lease creation (worker + any other lease writers)
          - Update serialization versioning carefully (keep schema_version = 1; field optional)
    - id: 'S2'
      description: |
        Add process identity helpers (prefer apm2-core, reusable across CLI + daemon):
          - read_proc_start_time_ticks(pid: u32) -> io::Result<u64>
            * parse /proc/<pid>/stat field 22 (starttime)
          - verify_pid_identity(pid, expected_start_ticks) -> ProcessIdentity
            * AliveMatch | AliveMismatch | Dead | Unknown
          - Must be pure/testable where possible; OS errors should be surfaced as Unknown.
    - id: 'S3'
      description: |
        Update lane status + reconcile to use identity:
          - crates/apm2-core/src/fac/lane.rs:
              * replace is_pid_alive checks with verify_pid_identity when start ticks available
              * derive_lane_state uses identity result (AliveMatch behaves like Alive; AliveMismatch behaves like Dead)
          - crates/apm2-core/src/fac/reconcile.rs:
              * when lock free + lease present:
                  - if identity == AliveMismatch => treat as stale lease (recover), DO NOT mark Corrupt
                  - if identity == Unknown => keep fail-closed behavior (Corrupt) but annotate reason
              * only insert job_id into active_job_ids when identity == AliveMatch (not mere PID existence)
    - id: 'S4'
      description: |
        Update acquire_worker_lane (fac_worker) to avoid taking a lane based on PID-only:
          - If lease exists and identity == AliveMismatch => remove lease (stale) and proceed
          - If identity == Unknown => skip lane and emit actionable log
    - id: 'S5'
      description: |
        Add tests (no PID reuse required):
          - Spawn a child process (sleep) and read its start ticks; assert identity matches.
          - Write a lease with the same pid but wrong start ticks; assert identity mismatch path is taken.
          - Reconcile test: a lane with lock free + lease (pid alive, start ticks mismatch) is recovered and its job is eligible for claimed→pending.

        Fix reconcile token-awareness (immediate fix for the requeue/replay-denial bug):
          - Before requeuing an orphaned claimed job, check whether the job has a channel_context_token
            with a consumed nonce in the token ledger.
          - If nonce is consumed: call MarkFailed instead of requeue.
          - If nonce is not consumed (or job has no token): existing requeue path is safe.
          - Applies at startup reconcile (OrphanedJobPolicy) and periodic reconcile-on-tick paths.
    - id: 'S7'
      description: |
        Add regression test for the specific failure sequence observed 2026-02-21:
          - Consume a token nonce (simulate via token_ledger WAL write).
          - Create an orphaned claimed job referencing that nonce.
          - Run reconcile with OrphanedJobPolicy::Requeue.
          - Assert job is NOT moved back to pending; assert it is marked failed.
          - Assert no subsequent replay-denial error is possible for this job.
        Longer-term note: bind reconcile token checks to authoritative token ledger state
        via daemon-mediated query rather than direct WAL reads, to support distributed reconcile.

    - 'Systemd unit liveness binding (separate ticket).'
    - 'Full lease/receipt schema version bump (optional later).'
    - 'Broader daemon-mediated token ledger authority (follow-on; note captured in S7).'

notes:
  safety_and_fail_closed: |
    - Identity mismatch MUST be treated as non-ownership; this is safer than killing or blocking.
    - Identity unknown MUST remain fail-closed (do not reclaim automatically) to avoid double execution.
  migration: |
    Existing leases will not have proc_start_time_ticks. The system should:
      - log a one-time warning when identity cannot be verified due to missing field
      - rely on other evidence (lock held + receipt presence + unit liveness) for safe recovery
      - naturally converge as new leases are written.
