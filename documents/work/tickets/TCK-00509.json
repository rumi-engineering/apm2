Silent deny (no receipt) is itself a defect.\n\nPCAC LIFECYCLE TESTS ARE MANDATORY: The lifecycle denial tests (revoked authority,\nstale authority, consumed token) are the binding evidence that economics ALLOW alone\ncannot authorize a projection. Without these tests, an attacker can exploit the gap\nbetween economics admission and authority validity to execute unauthorized projections.\n",
      "verification": "Test fixtures must cover all ContinuityDecision::Deny variants from the economics\nmodule to ensure no deny path is untested at the integration level.\nAdditionally, test fixtures must cover all lifecycle denial variants:\n(1) authority revoked between economics check and effect,\n(2) authority stale at revalidation time,\n(3) token already consumed through alternate path,\n(4) replayed intent with revoked authority after outage.\n",
