        reason: "Chapter 18 CAC overlay depends on chapter 17 schema-qualified snapshot registry baseline."
  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Add matrix rules requiring promotion-critical claims to carry CAC schema, digest-set, canonicalizer, and Tier2+ fail-closed trigger fields."
      - "Add a dedicated CAC contract overlay matrix for promotion-critical traceability rows."
      - "Explicitly model RoleSpec context injection claims so efficiency/code-quality gains are tied to deterministic selector-closed CAC context delivery."
      - "Bind CAC overlay rows to concrete TRC-FAC claims (`TRC-FAC-01`, `TRC-FAC-02`, `TRC-FAC-07`, `TRC-FAC-12`, `TRC-FAC-14`, `TRC-FAC-15`, `TRC-FAC-16`)."
      - "Define explicit unresolved-ambiguity escalation semantics (`deny + freeze -> halt escalation`) for Tier2+ timelines."
      - "Ensure CAC overlay is coherent with RFC-0028 gate CAC contracts and RFC-0029 predicate/gate CAC contracts."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Introducing new non-CAC gate families."
      - "Changing baseline FAC gate ordering beyond CAC data-contract requirements."
      - "Kernel/runtime implementation changes."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Augment matrix rules with CAC overlay requirements for promotion-critical claims."
      - "Introduce chapter 18 CAC overlay table with schema/digest/canonicalizer/fail-closed columns."
      - "Add TRC-FAC-10 CAC overlay row for RoleSpec/context-pack/selector determinism and minimality."
      - "Populate row-level mappings for all promotion-critical temporal/recovery/isolation claims."
      - "Cross-check against RFC-0028 and RFC-0029 CAC sections for consistency."
      - "Validate dependency and evidence links for machine readability."

      - "EVID-0006"
    criteria:
      - "REQ-0021 promotion-critical CAC overlay requirements are represented in chapter 18."
      - "RFC-0019 chapter 18 has an explicit CAC promotion-critical overlay matrix."
      - "Each listed TRC row includes schema contracts, digest-set bindings, canonicalizer bindings, and Tier2+ fail-closed trigger text."
      - "TRC-FAC-10 binds RoleSpec context injection determinism/minimality to explicit CAC schema and digest contracts."
      - "Tier2+ unresolved CAC ambiguity is explicitly non-promotable and escalation-bounded."
      - "Cross-RFC CAC overlay content is consistent with chapter 17 snapshot registry and RFC-0028/0029 CAC contracts."
  notes:
    security: |
      Traceability rows are non-admissible when CAC schema/digest/canonicalizer surfaces are missing,
      ambiguous, stale, or unverifiable.
    verification: |
      Validate matrix row coverage for all promotion-critical claims and verify no row can pass without
      explicit CAC fail-closed behavior.
    general: |
      Governance backfill ticket created because RFC-0019 (pre-RFC-0020) traceability surfaces were
      patched to add CAC contract precision.
