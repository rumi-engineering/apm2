    tickets:
      - ticket_id: "TCK-00520"
        reason: "Streaming logs/caps must exist."
      - ticket_id: "TCK-00521"
        reason: "Policy-driven env allowlist/denylist required."
  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Implement Rust bounded executor that creates transient systemd units and streams logs with caps."
      - "Replace `scripts/ci/run_bounded_tests.sh` usage in FAC paths (keep script as fallback only during transition)."
      - "Use FacPolicyV1 env_clear/allowlist/denylist to pass env; no ad-hoc allowlists."
      - "Ensure timeouts/memory/pids are enforced by unit properties, not by shell timers."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Replacing other CI scripts unrelated to execution."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Implement executor library used by gates/warm/pipeline."
      - "Add feature flag for transition period."
      - "Deprecate shell runner once stable."
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids: []
    criteria:
      - "Bounded tests run with streaming logs and hard caps without relying on a brittle shell allowlist."
      - "Failure modes produce receipts with actionable diagnostics."
  amendments:
    - amendment_id: "AMD-2026-02-16-FAC-THROUGHPUT-PIVOT"
      summary: "Clarify that bounded executor requirements are containment-focused and do not prescribe low default CPU throughput."
      supersedes:
        - "Implicit coupling of throughput defaults to conservative bounded caps."
      replacement:
        - "Default throughput profile may use host-max queue-managed parallelism."
        - "Bounded execution remains required for security containment and fail-closed behavior."
