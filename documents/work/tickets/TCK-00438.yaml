  plan:
    steps:
      - "Execute TCK-00449..TCK-00452 in dependency order."
      - "Run integrated launch/replay/stale-state/adversarial checks across slices."

    criteria:
      - "All child tickets TCK-00449..TCK-00452 are complete."
      - "Launch path is hash-bound, boundary-safe, liveness-auditable, and fail-closed under ambiguity."
      - "Auditor/orchestrator projections are receipt-backed and deterministic."
  notes:
    security: |
      Authority-bearing launch remains default-deny with strict boundary and liveness controls.
    verification: |
      Integration validation must include replay, stale-state, unauthorized-path, and ambiguity scenarios.
    general: |
      Detailed subagent launch implementation has been decomposed into smaller executable slices.
