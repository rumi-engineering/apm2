      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement AuthoritySealV1 supporting direct and Merkle-batch seal kinds
    - Enforce domain separation by artifact kind and schema version
    - Require ledger/quorum anchor binding for authoritative seals
    out_of_scope:
    - ReceiptPointer defaults and multiproof transport (TCK-00363)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement AuthoritySealV1 supporting direct and Merkle-batch seal
      kinds'
    - 'Implement: Enforce domain separation by artifact kind and schema version'
    - 'Implement: Require ledger/quorum anchor binding for authoritative seals'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0016
    - EVID-0306
    criteria:
    - AuthoritySeal verifies both direct and batch-authenticated facts
    - Unsigned/free-floating batch roots are rejected for authority use
    - Domain separation tags are required and validated
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
