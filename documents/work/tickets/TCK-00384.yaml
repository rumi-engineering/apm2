      - "Track tool_calls count in session state, increment on each RequestTool dispatch."
      - "Track events_emitted count in session state, increment on each EmitEvent dispatch."

  plan:
    steps:
      - "Add `tool_calls: AtomicU64`, `events_emitted: AtomicU64`, and `started_at_ns: u64` fields to the session entry in the session registry."
      - "In SpawnEpisode handler, set `started_at_ns = SystemTime::now()` when creating session entry."
      - "In SessionDispatcher::handle_request_tool, increment `tool_calls` counter after successful dispatch."

      - "In SessionDispatcher::handle_session_status, read real values from session state instead of hardcoded zeros."
      - "Compute duration_ms as `(current_time_ns - started_at_ns) / 1_000_000`."
      - "Add unit tests verifying counters increment correctly."
      - "Add integration test: spawn session, execute tools, emit events, query status, verify non-zero counters."
  definition_of_done:
    criteria:
      - "`apm2 episode session-status` returns accurate tool_calls count (not 0)."
      - "`apm2 episode session-status` returns accurate events_emitted count (not 0)."
      - "`apm2 episode session-status` returns real started_at_ns timestamp."
      - "duration_ms reflects actual session duration, not raw epoch time."
      - "Counters are thread-safe (atomic operations)."
  notes:
    context: |
      The SessionStatus handler in session_dispatch.rs (lines 1675-1677) returns
      hardcoded zeros for all telemetry fields:

        tool_calls: 0,     // TODO: Track in session telemetry
        events_emitted: 0, // TODO: Track in session telemetry
        started_at_ns: 0,  // TODO: Track session start time

      The duration_ms field (line 1678) is set to SystemTime::now() as epoch
      milliseconds, which is NOT the session duration -- it's the current wall
      time since 1970 (~1.77 trillion ms). This makes the coordinate command's
      token estimation unreliable.

      AAT finding: `apm2 episode session-status` returned:
        Tool Calls:     0
        Events Emitted: 0
        Duration (ms):  1770326257976
      The duration value is clearly raw epoch nanoseconds, not session duration.
