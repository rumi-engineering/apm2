root_cause_analysis:
  summary: |
    FAC push/review had several brittle integration edges that could stall the
    lifecycle or degrade reviewer trust:
    1) `fac review prepare` could diff against an incorrect base after main
       advanced, producing empty or misleading review inputs.
    2) Verdict projection behavior around comment lifecycle/fan-in was fragile,
       especially across re-runs and per-SHA comment identity.
    3) Legacy CLI subcommands overlapped with lifecycle/doctor semantics and
       increased operational confusion.
    4) Push warm-path dedup behavior needed to stay closure-complete and
       non-blocking when gates were already satisfied.

scope:
  in_scope:
    - id: "S6_PREPARE_BASE_SHA"
      title: "Fix fac review prepare to use pr.base.sha instead of origin/main"
      detail: |
        Ensure `apm2 fac review prepare` resolves base from GitHub PR metadata
        (`pr.base.sha`) when available, with strict SHA validation and reachable
        fallback to local main refs for offline operation.

    - id: "S7_REMOVE_OBSOLETE_COMMANDS"
      title: "Remove obsolete FAC CLI subcommands"
      detail: |
        Remove superseded review subcommands now covered by lifecycle + doctor:
        `fac review dispatch`, `fac review wait`, `fac review status`,
        `fac review project`, and `fac resume`.

    - id: "S8_VERDICT_COMMENT_POSTING"
      title: "Harden verdict projection fan-in and per-SHA comment behavior"
      detail: |
        Projection behavior for GitHub verdict comments must satisfy:
        1. One combined verdict comment per PR head SHA, emitted once all active
           dimensions are resolved for that SHA.
        2. New review rounds (new head SHA) post a new comment; previous-round
           comments are not edited as live state.
        3. Projection rendering includes all findings and the decision model ID
           per dimension (`model_id`) in place of `set_by`.
        4. Create-path posting must preserve merged dimension payload for the
           same SHA (no dimension loss during reinitialization/replay).
        5. Projection failures must be surfaced as hard errors.

    - id: "S9_DEDUP_CACHE_AND_PUSH"
      title: "Treat AlreadyCompleted dedup as pass-through for push"
      detail: |
        `DenialReasonCode::AlreadyCompleted` indicates deduplicated success for
        an already-completed SHA and must not block `apm2 fac push`. Use
        existing cache/context fields to resolve gate outcomes without rerun.

    - id: "S10_HIDE_GATES_COMMAND"
      title: "Hide `apm2 fac gates` from public CLI help"
      detail: |
        Keep command callable for internal/debug use, but hide it from public
        help output to reduce accidental operator misuse.

    - "S1_CLOSURE_SCHEMA deferred to TCK-00624."

plan:
  steps:
    - id: "STEP_01"
      title: "Stabilize prepare head/base resolution"
      detail: |
        Keep strict SHA validation for cached/API refs, prefer PR base SHA,
        and treat stale local identity as non-authoritative hint with fallback.

    - id: "STEP_02"
      title: "Finalize per-SHA verdict projection semantics"
      detail: |
        Ensure create/update paths preserve merged payload for same SHA,
        maintain per-SHA round separation, and surface projection failures.

    - id: "STEP_03"
      title: "Align lifecycle replay and projection wiring"
      detail: |
        Keep replay scoped to matching PR + SHA, prevent stale-SHA fanout,
        and maintain closure-complete push progression.

    - id: "STEP_04"
      title: "Wire typed queue/pipeline failure taxonomy"
      detail: |
        Distinguish prep supply unavailable, authority denied, and gate
        execution failures in gates queue path outputs.

    - id: "STEP_05"
      title: "Dogfood push/review and verify idempotent warm-path"
      detail: |
        Validate no stuck `apm2 fac push` behavior, warm-path dedup reuse, and
        reviewer lifecycle progression under repeated pushes.

    - "Dogfooded `apm2 fac push` warm-path remains bounded and idempotent."

notes:
  context: |
    This ticket now tracks closure-complete push/review hardening and lifecycle
    correctness. Foundational closure-schema/signing work is explicitly tracked
    in TCK-00624 to avoid mixed-scope acceptance ambiguity.
  security: |
    Strict SHA validation, stale-state rejection, typed failure surfaces, and
    per-SHA projection isolation preserve audit integrity and fail-closed
    behavior.
