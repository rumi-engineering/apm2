# Ticket: TCK-00002 — Define kernel event schemas with prost

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00002
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Create proto/ directory with .proto files
- Define KernelEvent envelope
- Define all event types (Session, Work, Tool, Lease, Policy, Adjudication, Evidence)
- Configure prost build.rs for code generation
- Add canonical encoding tests

Out of scope:
- Tool protocol messages (TCK-00013)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0002
- REQ-0012
- REQ-0029

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0008

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0008

Criteria:
- Proto files compile without errors
- Generated Rust types are usable
- Canonical encoding produces deterministic bytes
- No maps in signed message types
- Roundtrip encode/decode tests pass

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
