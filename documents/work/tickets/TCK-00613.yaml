    summary: |
      The prior revision of this ticket mixed two incompatible directions:
      - A new trait/registry gate engine with gate-set `--profile`.
      - The already-adopted command-centric FAC gates runtime with throughput
        profiles and typed gate checks.

      In parallel, PR review surfaced concrete security and correctness gaps:
      - Signing key TOCTOU and duplicated key-handling paths.
      - Unbounded file reads in gates/preflight paths.
      - Worker workspace-root trust boundary ambiguity.
      - Process-global CWD mutation in worker execution path.
      - workflow_dispatch authorization trust override via env var.
      - test_safety_guard misses on top-level `src/*.rs` and unbounded traversal.

      This ticket update formalizes the architecture actually in use and binds
      DoD to hardened, fail-closed behavior across FAC gates and preflight.
  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Architecture contract: command-centric gates execution remains authoritative (`fac_review/gates.rs` orchestration + typed checks in `fac_review/gate_checks.rs`)."
      - "Gate selection semantics: keep `--quick` as gate-set selector (fast subset) and full mode as default behavior."
      - "Throughput semantics: keep `--gate-profile` (`throughput`/`balanced`/`conservative`) for resource/concurrency policy, independent of gate-set selection."
      - "Introduce shared hardened signer-key utility (`fac_key_material`) and remove duplicated key creation/loading logic across queue submit, worker, and broker paths."
      - "Introduce shared fail-closed bounded-read utility (`fac_secure_io`) and replace raw unbounded reads in FAC review gate checks, FAC preflight, FAC broker, queue submit, and worker-adjacent read sites."
      - "Enforce fail-closed handling for oversized/unreadable inputs in security-sensitive paths (no skip-on-error behavior for authorization/gate enforcement inputs)."
      - "Remove process-global CWD mutation from worker execution path; pass explicit workspace root through the gates call chain."
      - "Define and enforce workspace-root admission policy in worker gates execution: canonical dir, git toplevel equality, repo identity binding, and explicit deny for FAC-internal roots."
      - "Strengthen preflight trust binding: no env override for actor permission, validated repository/actor normalization, bounded event/policy/PR JSON parsing, and explicit deny on permission lookup failure."
      - "Harden test_safety_guard determinism and coverage: tracked-file-first targeting, top-level `src/lib.rs` and `src/main.rs` coverage under `#[cfg(test)]`, and bounded fail-closed file reads."
      - "Add regression tests for key creation race, workflow_dispatch permission checks, oversized payload denial, workspace-root policy denial, and top-level Rust test-safety detection."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Mandating a `gates_engine/` trait/registry abstraction (`Gate`, `GateRegistry`, `GateRunner`) in this ticket."
      - "Replacing current gate-set semantics with a new `--profile <gate-set>` CLI contract in this ticket."
      - "Repository-wide deletion of all shell scripts outside the FAC gates/preflight hardening scope."
      - "Backward-compatibility shims for superseded ticket language."
      - "Global scheduler redesign or distributed queue architecture changes."

      - id: "STEP_01"
        title: "Codify architecture and CLI contract"
        detail: |
          Lock the canonical model for this ticket:
          - `fac_review/gates.rs` orchestrates execution.
          - `--quick` controls gate-set shape.
          - `--gate-profile` controls throughput/resource policy only.
      - id: "STEP_02"
        title: "Centralize hardened key material handling"
        detail: |
          Add shared signer utility for secure create/load semantics:
          - create with owner-only mode at open time
          - nofollow safeguards
          - fsync of file and parent dir
          - race-safe concurrent creator convergence
          Replace all duplicate key handling in queue submit/worker/broker.
      - id: "STEP_03"
        title: "Centralize bounded fail-closed file reads"
        detail: |
          Add shared bounded I/O helper and migrate targeted paths off raw
          `fs::read` / `fs::read_to_string` for security-sensitive inputs.
      - id: "STEP_04"
        title: "Harden worker execution boundary"
        detail: |
          Remove ambient CWD dependency and enforce explicit workspace-root
          admission checks (canonicalize + git root + repo bind + FAC-internal
          deny rules).
      - id: "STEP_05"
        title: "Harden preflight trust binding"
        detail: |
          Remove env-based actor-permission override from authorization path,
          enforce repository/actor normalization, and deny on oversized/invalid
          preflight payloads or permission lookup failures.
      - id: "STEP_06"
        title: "Fix gate correctness regressions"
        detail: |
          Ensure test_safety_guard covers top-level `src/*.rs` test regions and
          uses bounded deterministic file targeting/read behavior.
      - id: "STEP_07"
        title: "Regression suite and verification"
        detail: |
          Run targeted security/correctness regressions and strict quality gates:
          - `cargo fmt --all`
          - `cargo clippy -p apm2-cli --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
          - `cargo test -p apm2-cli`

    criteria:
      - "Ticket language is internally consistent with implemented architecture: command-centric gates orchestration + throughput profiles."
      - "Signer key lifecycle is centralized; queue submit, worker, and broker use shared hardened key material helpers."
      - "No production path creates signing keys via write-then-chmod TOCTOU sequence."
      - "Bounded read helper is shared and used across targeted FAC gates/preflight/broker/queue paths; oversized inputs are denied fail-closed."
      - "Worker gates execution path does not mutate process-global CWD."
      - "Worker workspace_root admission denies FAC-internal roots and repo-identity mismatches; git toplevel binding is enforced."
      - "workflow_dispatch authorization does not trust env permission overrides and denies on lookup failure or insufficient permission."
      - "Preflight event/policy payload reads are bounded and oversized payloads fail closed."
      - "test_safety_guard evaluates top-level `src/lib.rs` and `src/main.rs` test regions and fails closed on oversized targets."
      - "Regression tests exist for signer concurrency, workflow_dispatch permission checks, oversized payload denial, and workspace-root policy denial."

      - "`cargo clippy -p apm2-cli --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` passes."
      - "`cargo test -p apm2-cli` passes."
  notes:
    context: |
      This amendment aligns TCK-00613 with the architecture currently used by
      FAC gates in this repository branch:
      - command-centric orchestration in `fac_review/gates.rs`
      - typed gate checks and evidence checks under `fac_review/*`
      - throughput profile model from TCK-00612

      It intentionally removes conflicting requirements that assumed this ticket
      was also the migration vehicle for a trait/registry gate engine and
      gate-set profile CLI redesign.
    amendments:
      - amendment_id: "AMD-2026-02-17-ARCH-REALIGNMENT"
        summary: "Replace conflicting gate-engine/profile requirements with branch-aligned architecture and hardening scope."
        supersedes:
          - "Requirement that TCK-00613 must introduce `gates_engine/` with `Gate` trait, `GateRegistry`, and `GateRunner`."
          - "Requirement that TCK-00613 must replace `--quick` with gate-set `--profile` semantics."
          - "Requirement that TCK-00613 must be the single vehicle for repository-wide script eradication."
        replacement:
          - "TCK-00613 defines and hardens the existing command-centric FAC gates model with explicit fail-closed security guarantees."
          - "Gate-set profile CLI redesign and trait/registry abstraction, if still desired, are follow-on architecture work and not blockers for this ticket."
    security: "default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed"
