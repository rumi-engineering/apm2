acceptance_criteria:
  - criterion: CI_SECURITY_GATES.md clearly distinguishes CI gates from internal gates
    verification: Documentation review
  - criterion: Agent Complexity gate documented as internal (GateRunner) not CI
    verification: Documentation review
  - criterion: Formal Proofs (kani/prusti) gate documented as internal not CI
    verification: Documentation review
  - criterion: safety-proof-coverage scope expanded to all crates or exclusions documented

  files_to_modify:
    - documents/security/CI_SECURITY_GATES.md
    - .github/workflows/ci.yml
  implementation_steps:
    - Update CI_SECURITY_GATES.md to clarify which gates run in GitHub Actions vs internal GateRunner
    - Add "Internal Gates (per PRD-0004)" section explaining Agent Complexity and Formal Proofs belong in internal gate system
    - Either expand safety-proof-coverage to scan all crates/ or document why xtask is excluded
  summary: |
    Address code quality review findings from PR #212. Per PRD-0004 (Work Substrate),
    GitHub Actions is a projection adapter - cognitive complexity and formal verification
    (kani/prusti) gates belong in the internal GateRunner system, not CI. Documentation
    must clearly distinguish between CI-enforced gates and internal gates.
notes: |
  Follow-up from PR #212 code quality review.
  PRD-0004 establishes that GitHub is a projection adapter and internal gates are authoritative.
  This ticket resolves documentation discrepancy flagged as MAJOR finding.
