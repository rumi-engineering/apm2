acceptance_criteria:
  - criterion: Direct GitHub status writes are removed or hard-disabled
    verification: Attempted status write fails closed with explicit error
  - criterion: xtask remains usable for dev workflows without GitHub status writes
    verification: xtask tasks complete with NON-AUTHORITATIVE banner and no GH writes
  - criterion: Replacement daemon/CLI projection paths exist before removal
    verification: Dependency checks in ticket graph confirm replacements landed

implementation:
  summary: |
    Stage X3: remove or hard-disable direct GitHub status writes after daemon/CLI
    replacements exist. xtask remains usable but explicitly non-authoritative and
    must not write external status signals.

      changes: |
        - Remove or hard-disable GitHub status writes
  implementation_steps:
    - "Disable direct GH status writes once replacements are available"
    - "Retain NON-AUTHORITATIVE banner"
    - "Update docs to reflect removal"

notes: |
  Phase: xtask Stage X3 (remove status writes last).
  Scope: Remove/disable GH status writes after replacements.
  Risk tier: T2 (medium).
  Keeps xtask usable: YES (non-authoritative only).
