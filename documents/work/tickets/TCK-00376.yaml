      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Remove all allow-by-manifest and non-broker actuation bypasses
    - Add regression tests proving tool execution requires broker+capability+context
      firewall
    - Set Tier2+ deny-default when required enforcement components unavailable
    out_of_scope:
    - Structured ToolKinds hardening (TCK-00377)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Remove all allow-by-manifest and non-broker actuation bypasses'
    - 'Implement: Add regression tests proving tool execution requires broker+capability+context
      firewall'
    - 'Implement: Set Tier2+ deny-default when required enforcement components unavailable'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0030
    - EVID-0307
    criteria:
    - No actuation path bypasses broker and policy checks
    - Unavailable enforcement dependency causes deny, never permissive fallback
    - Regression suite prevents bypass reintroduction
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
