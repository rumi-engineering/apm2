root_cause_analysis:
  summary: |
    Two compounding bugs observed across PR 739 and PR 740, both introduced
    recently and both serious enough to block local merges and corrupt the
    audit trail.

    BUG 1: Lifecycle state machine stuck at `gates_failed` after gate retry
      Location: push.rs (worker retry path), lifecycle.rs (apply_event)
      Observed: PR 740 doctor shows lifecycle.state="gates_failed",
        updated_at="2026-02-18T04:54:41Z". All gate results show
        completed_at="2026-02-18T04:58:44Z" with status PASS. The lifecycle
        event log's last_event_seq=18 with no GatesStarted/GatesPassed events
        recorded after the GatesFailed. The local merge never triggered.
      Cause: When the FAC worker retries gates after a failure, the gate
        results and PR body gate-status block are updated successfully, but
        the lifecycle state machine does not receive the required
        GatesStarted event before GatesPassed. The transition
        `gates_failed + gates_passed` is an illegal transition in the
        state machine (lifecycle.rs:3736-3739); it returns an error that
        is silently swallowed (WARNING log, not a fail-closed abort).
        The lifecycle therefore remains at `gates_failed` indefinitely.
        The gate store (save_gates_admission) and PR body are updated by
        the gate runner independently of the lifecycle state machine, which
        is why gates show PASS everywhere except the lifecycle. The merge
        trigger (maybe_auto_merge_if_ready) reads lifecycle state, so it
        never fires.
      Evidence: push.rs:1933-1964 (success path) emits PushObserved →
        GatesStarted → GatesPassed in sequence. The worker retry path
        must be omitting PushObserved or GatesStarted, landing directly
        on GatesPassed from gates_failed which is illegal.

    BUG 2: Second reviewer creates a new verdict comment instead of
      editing the first reviewer's comment
      Location: verdict_projection.rs:689-733 (project_decision_comment),
        verdict_projection.rs:535-563 (record initialization)
      Observed: PR 740 GitHub issue comments show three comments:
        - #3918509559 (old SHA 9a1b7dc6, both s1 reviewers correctly shared)
        - #3918628330 (new SHA eb5992f7, created by security reviewer s2)
        - #3918654234 (new SHA eb5992f7, created by quality reviewer s2)
        The two comments on eb5992f7 are identical in structure but posted
        separately. The s1 pair correctly shared one comment.
      Cause: When the first reviewer (security) completes, it finds no
        existing projection record for SHA eb5992f7, creates a new record
        with a local placeholder comment ID, then calls
        project_decision_comment. Inside project_decision_comment, since
        decision_comment_url is empty for a newly created record, it
        resolves to `local://fac_projection/...`. This means
        can_patch_existing=false (line 711: URL must start with
        "https://github.com/"), so create_issue_comment is called and
        returns the real GitHub comment ID 3918628330. The record is then
        saved with decision_comment_id=3918628330 and
        decision_comment_url="https://github.com/...".
        When the second reviewer (quality) calls the same function, it
        SHOULD load the existing record via load_decision_projection_for_home
        and find decision_comment_url populated. However, quality instead
        creates comment #3918654234, implying it did not find the saved
        record. The most likely cause is that quality's
        load_decision_projection_for_home call either:
          (a) Raced with security's save (projection_lock scope too narrow),
              so quality saw no record and created a fresh one; or
          (b) The quality reviewer's verdict_projection call was initiated
              during a model-fallback restart (restart_count=3 observed),
              and an earlier write from a failed restart left the record in
              an inconsistent state (e.g., decision_comment_url empty or
              pointing to a local:// URL), causing can_patch_existing=false
              on the final attempt, which then fell through to create.
        In either case the fallback `create_issue_comment` (line 723) fires
        unconditionally when can_patch_existing is false or when
        update_issue_comment returns an error, creating a duplicate comment
        with no mechanism to reconcile or tombstone the orphaned one.

  in_scope:
    - id: "S1_FIX_LIFECYCLE_GATE_RETRY"
      title: "Ensure gate retry path emits GatesStarted before GatesPassed"
      detail: |
        In the worker retry path for failed gates, emit lifecycle events in
        the correct order:
          PushObserved → GatesStarted → (gate run) → GatesPassed or GatesFailed
        PushObserved must fire before GatesStarted so the state machine
        transitions: gates_failed → pushed → gates_running → gates_passed.
        Skipping PushObserved leaves the state at gates_failed; then
        GatesStarted (gates_failed + gates_started → gates_running) will
        succeed, but if even GatesStarted is missing the illegal transition
        GatesPassed from gates_failed will be silently ignored.
        Audit all code paths that run gates and emit lifecycle events to
        confirm the canonical PushObserved → GatesStarted → GatesPassed/
        GatesFailed ordering is always preserved.

    - id: "S2_FAIL_CLOSED_LIFECYCLE_ILLEGAL_TRANSITION"
      title: "Fail closed (not WARNING) on illegal lifecycle transitions in push path"
      detail: |
        In push.rs:1682-1701 (failure path) and analogous worker paths,
        illegal lifecycle transitions currently emit WARNING and continue.
        This masks bugs like the gates_failed stuck state for an unbounded
        time. The push/worker should fail-closed on lifecycle event
        application errors, not swallow them. At minimum, any illegal
        transition on GatesStarted or GatesPassed must be treated as a
        hard error that surfaces in the push attempt receipt and triggers
        the error budget / retry logic.

    - id: "S3_FIX_DUPLICATE_VERDICT_COMMENT"
      title: "Fix project_decision_comment to always patch existing comment"
      detail: |
        In verdict_projection.rs:project_decision_comment (lines 689-733):
        The can_patch_existing guard (line 711) requires
        decision_comment_url to start with "https://github.com/". For
        newly created records, decision_comment_url is always empty,
        forcing create_issue_comment even when a sibling reviewer has
        already posted a comment for this SHA.
        Fix: after loading or creating the projection record, if
        decision_comment_id > 0 and decision_comment_url is empty or
        local://, attempt to resolve the real GitHub comment URL from the
        GitHub API (GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{id}) before
        falling back to create. If the comment exists on GitHub, patch it;
        only create a new comment if no real GitHub comment exists for
        this SHA.
        Additionally, hold the projection_lock for the full duration of
        the record-load → comment-post → record-save cycle to prevent
        races between concurrent reviewer completions.

    - id: "S4_LOCK_SCOPE_PROJECTION_WRITE"
      title: "Hold projection lock across load → post → save cycle"
      detail: |
        The _projection_lock (verdict_projection.rs:533) is currently
        acquired before load_decision_projection_for_home but may be
        released before project_decision_comment returns and the record
        is saved. This creates a window where two concurrent reviewers
        each see no existing record, each call create_issue_comment, and
        each save a different comment ID into the record (last writer wins,
        first comment orphaned).
        Ensure the lock is held across: load → upsert dimension → sign
        → post comment → save record. The lock must be exclusive per-PR
        (not per-dimension) so security and quality cannot interleave.

    - id: "S5_TOMBSTONE_ORPHANED_COMMENTS"
      title: "Detect and tombstone orphaned verdict comments"
      detail: |
        When a second comment is erroneously created for a SHA that already
        has a verdict comment, the first comment becomes orphaned (it will
        not receive future dimension updates). Add a check on
        project_decision_comment: if create_issue_comment is called and
        succeeds, compare the returned comment ID against any existing
        known comment ID for this PR. If they differ, edit the older
        comment with a tombstone body ("superseded by #NEW_ID") to prevent
        reviewers reading two conflicting verdict blocks.

    - id: "S6_REGRESSION_TESTS"
      title: "Regression tests"
      detail: |
        - Test: after gate retry succeeds (GatesFailed → worker re-run →
          all gates pass), lifecycle.state advances to gates_passed and
          then to a merge-ready state, not stuck at gates_failed.
        - Test: concurrent security + quality reviewer completions for the
          same SHA produce exactly one GitHub issue comment, not two.
        - Test: if update_issue_comment fails (mock GitHub error), the
          comment URL is resolved via GET before falling back to create.
        - Test: illegal lifecycle transition in gate success path is a
          hard error, not a WARNING.

      detail: |
        Search push.rs and fac_worker.rs for every site that runs gates
        and emits lifecycle events. For each: confirm PushObserved →
        GatesStarted → (run) → GatesPassed/GatesFailed ordering.
        Identify the worker retry path that is missing PushObserved or
        GatesStarted.

      detail: |
        In the worker retry gate path: emit PushObserved before

      detail: |
        Before can_patch_existing check: if decision_comment_id > 0 and
        decision_comment_url is empty/local://, attempt GET of GitHub

notes:
  context: |
    Both bugs were observed live on PR 740 (TCK-00567, SHA eb5992f7):
    - lifecycle.state stuck at gates_failed (updated_at 2026-02-18T04:54:41Z)
      while all gate results show PASS at 2026-02-18T04:58:44Z.
      Local merge did not trigger. TCK-00567 commits are on the feature
      branch only, not on local main.
    - GitHub issue comments #3918628330 (security s2, 04:57:44) and
      #3918654234 (quality s2, 05:01:04) are two separate comments on
      SHA eb5992f7, each containing only one reviewer's verdict.
      The s1 pair on old SHA 9a1b7dc6 correctly shared comment #3918509559.
    The gate retry lifecycle bug is the more critical of the two: it
    silently prevents all local merges whenever any gate fails and retries.
    The duplicate comment bug corrupts the review audit trail and can cause
    the orchestrator to read an incomplete verdict block.
  security: "default-deny, fail-closed on lifecycle transition errors"
