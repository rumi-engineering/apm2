# Ticket: TCK-00016 — Implement inference syscall adapter

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00016
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Implement InferenceCall tool
- Provider abstraction (local, remote)
- Token budget deduction
- Prompt/response logging

Out of scope:
- Specific provider implementations (adapter code)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0004
- REQ-0019
- REQ-0034

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0003
- EVID-0018

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0003
- EVID-0018

Criteria:
- InferenceCall submits to provider
- Token budget deducted
- Prompts/responses logged (hashed)
- Provider switchable via config
- Timeout handling

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
