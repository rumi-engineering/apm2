      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement IdentityProofProfileV1 schema and profile hash pinning
    - Require identity_proof_profile_hash in directory heads and session-open path
    - Fail Tier2+ actuation on unknown or mismatched proof profiles
    out_of_scope:
    - Verifier cache invalidation behavior (TCK-00359)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement IdentityProofProfileV1 schema and profile hash pinning'
    - 'Implement: Require identity_proof_profile_hash in directory heads and session-open
      path'
    - 'Implement: Fail Tier2+ actuation on unknown or mismatched proof profiles'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0012
    - EVID-0304
    criteria:
    - Profile hash mismatch blocks authoritative verification
    - Session-open path records active proof profile hash
    - Unsupported profiles are rejected deterministically
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
