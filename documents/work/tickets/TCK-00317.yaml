  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Define reviewer v0 capability manifest schema
    - Store manifest in CAS
    - SpawnEpisode loads manifest by hash
    out_of_scope:
    - Implementor capability manifest (future)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep beyond out_of_scope
      list.
    - 'Implement: Define reviewer v0 capability manifest schema'
    - 'Implement: Store manifest in CAS'
    - 'Implement: SpawnEpisode loads manifest by hash'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression risks per
      RFC-0019/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding EVID-*
      artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0002
    criteria:
    - 'Reviewer manifest allows: GitOperation (read), ArtifactFetch, ListFiles, Search'
    - Manifest stored in CAS with content hash
    - SpawnEpisode resolves manifest from policy
  notes:
    security: Productivity-first; keep fail-closed invariants intact where already mandated by
      RFC-0019.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests and CAS/ledger replay checks; avoid relying on process
      memory.
    general: Keep changes minimal, explicit, and reversible; make dependencies and attribution
      fields queryable.
