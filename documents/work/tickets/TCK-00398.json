      "context": "AAT evidence (H9: NEEDS_ADJUDICATION) discovered that the daemon successfully persists events\n(WorkClaimed, WorkTransitioned, SessionStarted, SessionEvent) but apm2 fac work status returns\n\"No events found.\" Root cause: the daemon writes to a table called ledger_events while the CLI\nreads from a table called events. The schemas are also structurally different.\n\nDaemon write schema (ledger.rs:49-71):\n  ledger_events(event_id TEXT PK, event_type TEXT, work_id TEXT, actor_id TEXT,\n                payload BLOB, signature BLOB, timestamp_ns INTEGER)\n\nCore read schema (schema.sql:11-67):\n  events(seq_id INTEGER PK AUTOINCREMENT, event_type TEXT, session_id TEXT, actor_id TEXT,\n         record_version INTEGER, payload BLOB, timestamp_ns INTEGER, prev_hash BLOB,\n         event_hash BLOB, signature BLOB, ...)\n\nThese tables have different names, different primary keys, different columns (work_id vs session_id),\nand different ordering semantics (text PK vs autoincrement). They will never see each other's data.\n\nIMPORTANT with recent TCK-00340 hardening (PR #450 patch series): daemon code now has additional\nledger_events-dependent query paths for lease/work validation. A big-bang table migration would be\nhigh-risk. This ticket therefore uses a phased approach: compatibility-first to restore CLI visibility,\nthen canonical unification with an explicit cutover plan.\n\nAdditionally, the daemon's emit_episode_event() uses episode_id as the work_id column value,\nwhile the CLI's extract_work_info() looks for work_id inside the JSON payload. This is a\nsecondary mismatch even if the table names were aligned.\n",

      "security": "- Schema migration must be idempotent (safe to run multiple times).\n- Signature and event_hash columns must be preserved — they provide tamper evidence.\n- Do not drop the ledger_events table during migration — rename or keep as backup.\n- Column types must match exactly between write and read paths to prevent silent truncation.\n"
