      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement signed CRDT directory merges with revocation-wins semantics
    - Require explicit re-admission anchors for post-revocation activation
    - Run partition/rejoin simulations with Byzantine reordering
    out_of_scope:
    - Anti-entropy transport protocol mechanics (TCK-00381)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement signed CRDT directory merges with revocation-wins semantics'
    - 'Implement: Require explicit re-admission anchors for post-revocation activation'
    - 'Implement: Run partition/rejoin simulations with Byzantine reordering'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0014
    - EVID-0304
    criteria:
    - Concurrent updates converge deterministically
    - Revoked identities cannot resurrect without explicit re-admission proof
    - Byzantine ordering does not violate revocation-wins law
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
