Additionally, when network is unavailable,\nthe failure surface is raw cargo/registry errors that implementors cannot\nact on without reading internal logs. Both problems are addressed together:\ndeny network in EXECUTE and collapse the supply-failure surface to one\nnormalized code in PREP.\n\nAdditionally, a 2026-02-19 reliability audit\nrevealed systemic FAC queue issues: the worker service fails to auto-restart\nafter daemon shutdown (8.5h outage), duplicate SHA executions waste up to\n11x capacity, 50% of jobs are denied with opaque/missing reasons, stale lane\nleases block capacity, torn state on job completion causes ambiguous outcomes,\nand review projection SHA mismatches cause false-negative staleness checks.\n"

When the second dimension\n  resolves (e.g., code-quality), the existing comment SHOULD be updated\n  via merge_remote_dimensions_payload() + update_issue_comment(), but\n  in practice the update does not occur — the comment remains showing\n  only the first dimension's verdict.\n\nRoot cause:\n  persist_verdict_projection_locked() (verdict_projection.rs:540) calls\n  project_decision_comment_with() (verdict_projection.rs:874) on each\n  individual verdict persist. The first call creates the comment. The\n  second call should fetch the existing comment, merge dimensions, and\n  update — but the merge/update path is not reliably executing.\n\nRequired behavior:\n  The GitHub projection MUST NOT post a verdict comment until ALL\n  active dimensions (ACTIVE_DIMENSIONS: [\"security\", \"code-quality\"])\n  have resolved. Specifically:\n\n  1. On each verdict persist, check whether all dimensions in\n     ACTIVE_DIMENSIONS have a non-pending decision in the local\n     projection record.\n  2. If any dimension is still pending: persist locally only, do NOT\n     post or update the GitHub comment.\n  3. Only when ALL dimensions have resolved: render the full\n     multi-dimension comment and post/update on GitHub.\n  4. The posted comment MUST contain all dimension verdicts in a\n     single rendering pass — no incremental posting.\n\nThis eliminates the race between \"first verdict posts\" and \"second\nverdict updates\" entirely: there is exactly one GitHub comment write\nper verdict cycle, and it always contains the complete picture.\n\nReferences:\n  - verdict_projection.rs:34-36 (ACTIVE_DIMENSIONS)\n  - verdict_projection.rs:540 (persist_verdict_projection_locked)\n  - verdict_projection.rs:832 (merge_remote_dimensions_payload)\n  - verdict_projection.rs:874 (project_decision_comment_with)\n  - verdict_projection.rs:1667 (aggregate_verdict_projection_overall_decision)\n  - github_projection.rs:155 (create_issue_comment)\n  - github_projection.rs:220 (update_issue_comment)\n"

The following artifacts are unused and create\nconfusion:\n\n1. REMOVE `strict_required_status_checks_policy: true` from\n   `.github/rulesets/protect-main.json` (line 30). This flag\n   enforces that ALL status checks must pass, which is overly\n   broad when the only authoritative check is the FAC commit\n   status. It can block merges on transient third-party checks\n   that are not part of the FAC contract.\n\n2. REMOVE `.github/workflows/forge-admission-cycle.yml`. This\n   workflow is a projection-only stub (workflow_dispatch only)\n   that does not compute FAC verdicts. The authoritative path\n   is `apm2 fac push` setting the commit status directly.
