      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Enforce linux-ns-v1 profile with namespaces, seccomp, cgroups
    - Deny ambient egress by default and confine workspace root
    - Add capsule escape and path traversal adversarial tests
    out_of_scope:
    - Context firewall TOCTOU integrity checks (TCK-00375)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Enforce linux-ns-v1 profile with namespaces, seccomp, cgroups'
    - 'Implement: Deny ambient egress by default and confine workspace root'
    - 'Implement: Add capsule escape and path traversal adversarial tests'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0028
    - EVID-0307
    criteria:
    - Tier3+ actuation executes only inside admitted capsule profile
    - Capsule egress defaults to deny unless policy grants explicit route
    - Escape attempts become blocking defects
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
