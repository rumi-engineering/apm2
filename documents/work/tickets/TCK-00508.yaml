  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Implement DeferredReplayWorker in crates/apm2-daemon/src/projection/ that periodically checks for buffered intents awaiting replay."
      - "On sink recovery detection (successful health probe or first ALLOW after prior DENY), drain backlog in ledger-order."
      - "For each replayed intent: re-evaluate economics gate AND re-execute PCAC lifecycle enforcement (join, revalidate authority freshness/revocation, single-use consume) — economics ALLOW alone is insufficient; call adapter.project_status() only after both economics gate and lifecycle enforcement pass; emit DeferredReplayReceiptV1 on convergence."
      - "Enforce replay_window_ref bounds from ProjectionContinuityWindowV1: intents older than replay window are expired with deny receipt, not replayed."
      - "Idempotent replay: skip intents whose (work_id, changeset_digest) already have a successful projection receipt (consumed-token check also prevents double-projection through alternate paths)."
      - "Compute backlog_digest (Blake3 over ordered intent digests) and include in replay receipt."
      - "Bounded replay batch size to prevent post-outage thundering herd (configurable, default 64 per cycle)."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Sink health probing mechanism (assume adapter.project_status() failure/success as the signal)."
      - "Multi-sink replay coordination."
      - "Replay priority ordering beyond ledger order."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Implement DeferredReplayWorker struct with reference to IntentBuffer, ProjectionAdapter, and ContinuityProfileResolver."
      - "Add periodic drain loop: query buffered intents ordered by created_at, batch by configurable limit."
      - "For each batch: re-evaluate economics gate, enforce PCAC lifecycle (revalidate authority, consume token), project on ALLOW from both checks, record result."
      - "Compute running backlog_digest as Blake3 over replayed intent digests."
      - "On batch completion with no remaining backlog: emit converged DeferredReplayReceiptV1 with replayed_item_count."
      - "Expire intents outside replay_window_ref with DENY_REPLAY_HORIZON_OUT_OF_WINDOW."
      - "Write unit tests: normal replay, idempotent skip, window expiration, batch limiting, convergence receipt generation."

    evidence_ids:

      - "EVID-0005"
    criteria:
      - "Buffered intents replay in ledger order after outage recovery."
      - "Intents outside replay window are expired with deny receipt, not silently dropped."
      - "Idempotent replay skips already-projected intents without error."
      - "Replayed intent with revoked authority is denied even if economics gate returns ALLOW — authority revocation is dominant."
      - "Replayed intent with already-consumed token is denied — single-use semantics hold across replay boundaries."
      - "Convergence receipt includes correct replayed_item_count and backlog_digest."
      - "Batch size limits prevent post-outage thundering herd."
  notes:
    security: |
      Replay must re-evaluate the economics gate for each intent — do NOT assume a
      previously-denied intent is now admissible just because the sink recovered.
      Gate inputs may have changed (revoked keys, updated profiles). Each replay
      is a fresh admission decision.

      PCAC LIFECYCLE ENFORCEMENT: Each replayed intent must undergo full lifecycle
      enforcement (join, revalidate, consume) in addition to economics re-evaluation.
      A buffered intent may carry authority that was valid at buffer time but has
      since been revoked. Economics gates check temporal windows, NOT authority
      freshness — these are orthogonal concerns. Without lifecycle enforcement,
      replay becomes an exploit vector: buffer an intent before revocation, replay
      after revocation, bypass authority checks via economics-only path.
    verification: |
      Include outage simulation test: buffer N intents during simulated outage,
      recover, verify replay in order with correct receipts. Include window
      expiration test: buffer intent, advance tick past window, verify expiration.
      Include replayed-revoked-authority test: buffer intent, revoke authority
      during outage, verify replay DENY despite economics ALLOW.
      Include replayed-consumed-token test: buffer intent, consume token through
      alternate path during outage, verify replay DENY (single-use).
    general: |
      This ticket delivers the "continuity during outage" promise from RFC-0029 REQ-0009.
      Without it, denied projections during outages are permanently lost.
