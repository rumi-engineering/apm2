# Ticket: TCK-00007 — Implement crash detection and restart logic

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00007
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- Detect session process exit
- Classify exit (success, failure, signal)
- Implement exponential backoff for restarts
- Recovery from ledger state

Out of scope:
- Quarantine logic (TCK-00008)

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0018
- REQ-0027
- REQ-0033

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0006

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0006

Criteria:
- Process exit detected and classified
- Exit classification emitted as event
- Backoff applied between restarts
- Session resumes from ledger cursor
- Restart limit configurable

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
