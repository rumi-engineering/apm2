        reason: "Scheduler state must exist."
  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Define per-job-kind cost estimates used for queue admission (e.g., expected ticks or wait units)."
      - "Record observed runtime/cost metrics in receipts."
      - "Implement a calibration mechanism that updates cost estimates conservatively over time (bounded, monotone-safe)."
      - "Expose `apm2 fac scheduler stats` (optional) showing cost model and denial reasons."
    out_of_scope:
      - "ML-based prediction."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Define CostModelV1 with conservative defaults."
      - "Add receipt fields for duration/cpu_time/bytes_written (best-effort)."
      - "Update worker to refine estimates within policy bounds."

    evidence_ids: []
    criteria:
      - "Queue admission inputs contain a deterministic cost estimate for every job."
      - "Calibration never makes the system less safe (never increases concurrency or budgets)."
