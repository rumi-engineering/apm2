  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Enforce stricter attestation requirements for Tier3+ and cross-cell ingestion
    - Bind attestation floor policy into envelopes and verification paths
    - Add deny/terminate behavior for floor violations
    out_of_scope:
    - Federation channel protocol rollout (TCK-00380..TCK-00382)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Enforce stricter attestation requirements for Tier3+ and cross-cell
      ingestion'
    - 'Implement: Bind attestation floor policy into envelopes and verification paths'
    - 'Implement: Add deny/terminate behavior for floor violations'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0033
    - EVID-0308
    criteria:
    - Tier3+ requests below attestation floor are denied
    - Cross-cell imported facts below floor are quarantined
    - Floor evaluations are receipt/audit-event visible
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
