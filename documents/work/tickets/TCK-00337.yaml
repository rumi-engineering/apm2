      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0019 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Identify and remove dead/unused modules or unsafe-by-default patterns (excluding xtask)
    - Update docs and references accordingly
    out_of_scope:
    - Large-scale architecture rewrites
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep beyond out_of_scope
      list.
    - 'Implement: Identify and remove dead/unused modules or unsafe-by-default patterns (excluding
      xtask)'
    - 'Implement: Update docs and references accordingly'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression risks per
      RFC-0019/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding EVID-*
      artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0015
    criteria:
    - Unused codepaths removed; build and tests pass
    - FAC v0 path remains stable
  notes:
    security: Productivity-first; keep fail-closed invariants intact where already mandated by
      RFC-0019.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests and CAS/ledger replay checks; avoid relying on process
      memory.
    general: Keep changes minimal, explicit, and reversible; make dependencies and attribution
      fields queryable.
