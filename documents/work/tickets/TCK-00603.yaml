  root_cause_analysis:
    summary: |
      fac_review still treats GitHub reads as operational authority in multiple CLI paths
      (orchestrator completion checks, head-sha resolution, findings/decision read paths,
      target auto-detection, and dispatch bootstrap). This creates fragile control-plane
      coupling to external APIs and allows projection outages to cause local lifecycle
      failures. FAC closure semantics must be local-authoritative and receipt-bound.
  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Remove GitHub REST authority from orchestrator control flow."
      - "Use local issue-comment projection cache for completion/dedup checks."
      - "Use git protocol (`git ls-remote origin refs/pull/<N>/head`) for non-REST SHA checks where needed."
      - "Remove gh-read fallback branches from decision/findings/publish/target and dispatch head resolution paths."
      - "Treat GitHub writes as projection-only best effort and keep local FAC progression authoritative."
      - "Switch `apm2 fac push` branch projection to always use `git push --force-with-lease`."
      - "Retain immediate GitHub comment projection attempts, but do not allow projection write failures to invalidate local decision authority when local projection artifacts exist."
      - "Define closure-complete contract as local approvals (FAC receipts) + local merge progression, independent of GitHub merged state."
      - "Update ticket notes to reflect local-main source-of-truth posture."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Replacing GitHub with a fully new external projection sink in this ticket."
      - "Large daemon-side projection architecture migration beyond fac_review-affecting paths."
      - "Protected-branch policy redesign on GitHub."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Patch barrier/orchestrator to remove gh REST read dependencies in run loop and completion checks."
      - "Patch decision/findings/publish/target/mod dispatch bootstrap to resolve authority from local artifacts only."
      - "Patch fac push to force-with-lease and projection-best-effort behavior."
      - "Keep projection adapter writes in github_projection as sink-only integration surface."
      - "Run formatting, clippy, and fac_review-targeted tests."
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids: []
    criteria:
      - "No `gh api` read dependency remains in orchestrator authoritative flow."
      - "Decision/findings/status paths can operate from local FAC artifacts without GitHub read fallback."
      - "`fac push` always uses `--force-with-lease`."
      - "Projection failures are warning-path where local authoritative state already has required identity."
      - "FAC review tests for touched modules pass."
  notes:
    security: |
      GitHub is a projection sink, not an authority source. Local FAC state, receipts,
      and local merge progression define control-plane truth. Projection outages must
      not mutate or roll back local truth.
