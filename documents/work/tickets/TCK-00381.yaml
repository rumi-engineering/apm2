  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement offer/compare/request/deliver anti-entropy protocol with pull-only
      semantics
    - Apply relay channel budgets, fanout caps, and replay protection
    - Run byzantine relay and partition/rejoin convergence simulations
    out_of_scope:
    - Epoch freshness gate enforcement for cross-cell authority (TCK-00382)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement offer/compare/request/deliver anti-entropy protocol with
      pull-only semantics'
    - 'Implement: Apply relay channel budgets, fanout caps, and replay protection'
    - 'Implement: Run byzantine relay and partition/rejoin convergence simulations'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0035
    - EVID-0309
    criteria:
    - Anti-entropy delivery is strictly pull-based and bounded
    - Byzantine relay behaviors cannot force authority acceptance
    - Partition/rejoin converges under revocation-wins semantics
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
