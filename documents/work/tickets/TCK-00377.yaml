      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Enforce typed ToolKind arguments with canonical validation rules
    - Implement git ref/path validation and idempotency preconditions
    - Gate structured shell bridge behind explicit allowlist policy
    out_of_scope:
    - Taint/confidentiality lattice propagation (TCK-00378)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Enforce typed ToolKind arguments with canonical validation rules'
    - 'Implement: Implement git ref/path validation and idempotency preconditions'
    - 'Implement: Gate structured shell bridge behind explicit allowlist policy'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0031
    - EVID-0308
    criteria:
    - Argument injection and path traversal regression suites pass
    - Non-idempotent tools declare and enforce preconditions
    - Raw command strings are not accepted on authoritative routes
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
