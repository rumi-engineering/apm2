      reason: Prerequisite per RFC-0020 ticket decomposition ordering
  scope:
    in_scope:
    - Implement EpochSealV1 schema, issuance, and verifier checks
    - Bind directory heads and receipt-batch epochs to epoch seals
    - Enforce monotonicity and reject rollback/equivocation in admission path
    out_of_scope:
    - Optional VDF profile (TCK-00366)
  plan:
    steps:
    - Read the bound requirement(s) and this ticket scope; confirm no scope creep
      beyond out_of_scope list.
    - 'Implement: Implement EpochSealV1 schema, issuance, and verifier checks'
    - 'Implement: Bind directory heads and receipt-batch epochs to epoch seals'
    - 'Implement: Enforce monotonicity and reject rollback/equivocation in admission
      path'
    - Add/adjust unit/integration tests to cover acceptance criteria and regression
      risks per RFC-0020/07_test_and_evidence.yaml.
    - Capture evidence artifacts (logs, receipts, test outputs) and update the corresponding
      EVID-* artifact with concrete artifact pointers.
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
    - EVID-0019
    - EVID-0309
    criteria:
    - Epoch seals issued for configured freshness-critical artifacts
    - Admission path rejects non-monotone or conflicting epoch sequences
    - Tier2+ authority admissions fail closed on missing/invalid seals
  notes:
    security: Fail-closed, least privilege, and explicit authority proofs are mandatory.
    verification: Prefer deterministic tests, replay/CAS evidence, and bounded-resource
      checks; avoid process-local assumptions.
    general: Keep scope atomic to this ticket, preserve explicit dependency ordering,
      and avoid introducing semantic drift from RFC-0020.
