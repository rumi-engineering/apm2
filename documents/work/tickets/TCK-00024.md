# Ticket: TCK-00024 — End-to-end integration tests

## Meta
- ticket_id: TCK-00024
- rfc_id: RFC-0001
- prd_id: PRD-0001
- custody_agent_roles: AGENT_IMPLEMENTER
- responsibility_domains: DOMAIN_KERNEL
- status: DRAFT

## Scope
In scope:
- E2E test with simulated agent
- Full workflow from spec to evidence
- Policy enforcement validation
- Evidence bundle verification
- Failure mode testing

Out of scope:
- Performance benchmarks

## Bindings
PRD/RFC requirement_ids:
- REQ-0001
- REQ-0026
- REQ-1003

Evidence ids (must resolve in PRD/RFC evidence bundles):
- EVID-0001
- EVID-1003

## Plan
Steps (deterministic, ordered):
1. (to be filled during implementation)

## Definition of Done (Evidence-based)
The ticket is complete only when all required evidence artifacts are captured and verification commands succeed.

evidence_ids:
- EVID-0001
- EVID-1003

Criteria:
- E2E test completes full workflow
- Evidence bundle generated
- Gate receipt passes
- Policy denials tested
- Failure modes (timeout, entropy) tested

## Verification
Run the verification commands recorded in the referenced evidence artifact definitions. Do not invent new commands here; update the evidence artifact objects instead.

## Notes
- Security posture: default-deny, least privilege, fail-closed.
- If a waiver is required, record it in the PRD/RFC waiver records and link the waiver id here.
