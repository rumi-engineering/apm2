  scope:
    in_scope:
      - "Define portable acceptance package contract with complete receipt pointers and verification metadata."
      - "Guarantee deterministic replay/reverification by at least two independent verifier implementations."
      - "Fail closed on missing, stale, or unverifiable imported authority claims."
      - "Add replay fixture generation and verifier-concordance reporting for promotion-critical traces."
    out_of_scope:
      - "Cross-organization key governance policy."
      - "Non-authoritative observability export formats."
  plan:
    steps:
      - "Define acceptance package schema and digest-set completeness constraints."
      - "Implement deterministic verifier harness and cross-verifier concordance checks."
      - "Add fail-closed behavior for incomplete or non-portable evidence bundles."
      - "Add integration tests that replay evidence without ambient runtime state."
  definition_of_done:
    evidence_ids:
      - "EVID-0005"
    criteria:
      - "Portable replay package is sufficient for deterministic third-party reverification."
      - "At least two verifier implementations produce matching admissibility verdicts."
      - "Any missing required receipt pointer yields deny."
  notes:
    security: |
      Authority trust is portable-evidence-based, not process-local-state-based.
    verification: |
      Include independent verifier replay tests and mismatch deny fixtures.
    general: |
      This ticket closes the replay portability requirement before promotion readiness gating.
