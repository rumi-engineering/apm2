    "i": "Business Strategy Protocol master CAC instruction: govern all business strategy decisions through first-principles axioms derived from physics, information theory, cognitive science, and computational limits — never from conventional business frameworks.",
    "pb": "Business strategy decisions are vulnerable to conventional-framework reasoning (Porter, BCG, SWOT) that treats historical patterns as causal laws. In an era of collapsing verification costs, agent-mediated markets, and dissolving organizational boundaries, strategy can be derived from invariant physical and information-theoretic constraints, not only from patterns that emerged under now-obsolete cost structures. This protocol surfaces 28 axioms across 8 domains to pressure-test strategic claims against first-principles admissibility, including infrastructure sovereignty, adversarial jurisdiction exclusion, and capital realism.",

    "lex": {
      "FIRST_PRINCIPLES_FOUNDATION": "Business strategy claims should be independently derivable from first principles (physics, information theory, cognitive science, computational limits) without relying on conventional business frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, BCG Matrix, SWOT, Blue Ocean, Lean Startup, etc.) as foundational premises. Framework references can be used as cross-checks after independent derivation. If a claim cannot be derived from physical, information-theoretic, or cognitive-scientific first principles, treat it as low-confidence and require stronger evidence.",
      "DUAL_ACTOR_MODEL": "Market, product, and organizational analysis should model two distinct actor classes: human actors (bounded attention, loss aversion, social proof dependence, narrative compression, status circuits) and agent actors (mechanical verification, parallel evaluation, delegated identity, distinct failure modes, compounding capabilities). Analyses that treat agents as faster humans or humans as slow agents are likely miscalibrated under regime change.",
      "VERIFICATION_TRAJECTORY": "Mechanical verification cost is on a collapsing trajectory driven by LLM-class agent capabilities, cryptographic proof maturation, and automated audit tooling. Business models, organizational structures, and competitive advantages should be analyzed under progressive verification cost collapse. Assets that appreciate under collapse (signed evidence, verifiable computation, audit-ready contracts) are structurally advantaged. Assets that depreciate (information asymmetry rents, institutional trust premiums, manual compliance margins) are structurally threatened.",
      "BSP_01": "Value requires state transformation: no value exists without a measurable change in the state of a system, material, information structure, or agent capability. Every business value claim must identify the specific input state, the transformation applied, the output state, and the beneficiary whose state improves. Mere relabeling, aggregation, or intermediation without transformation is rent-seeking that mechanical verification will erode. Grounded in thermodynamic work (LAW-01, INV-F-01).",
      "BSP_02": "All transformation is thermodynamically lossy (second law of thermodynamics). Energy, compute, attention, and coordination are consumed in every value-creating transformation. Margins exist because transformation cost is nonzero. The gap between value delivered and transformation cost is the only sustainable margin; all other margin is information-asymmetry rent vulnerable to verification cost collapse. Grounded in entropy irreversibility (LAW-03, INV-F-02).",
      "BSP_03": "Time is irreversible and commitments consume future option space. Capital deployed, reputation staked, trust extended, brand associations formed, and organizational structures instantiated cannot be uncommitted without loss. Every strategic commitment creates path dependence. Irreversibility analysis (what state is consumed, what options are foreclosed, what dependencies are created) is mandatory before commitment. Grounded in causal irreversibility (LAW-05, PRIN-091).",
      "BSP_04": "Energy, compute, bandwidth, storage, and verification have nonzero physical costs set by thermodynamic and information-theoretic limits (Landauer, Shannon, Bremermann). No business can sustain margins below the physical cost floor of its value transformation. Unit economics must include explicit physical cost floor analysis. Claims of zero-marginal-cost scaling are false without specifying which costs approach zero and which remain floor-bound. Grounded in physical realizability (INV-F-04, INV-F-05).",
      "BSP_05": "Information asymmetry is the root cause of all trust problems and the structural basis for every intermediary. Every middleman, broker, auditor, rating agency, and certification body exists because one party cannot cheaply verify the claims of another. When mechanical verification cost drops below institutional verification cost for a given claim class, the intermediary's margin is structurally threatened. Grounded in information-theoretic constraints (LAW-06, PRIN-076).",
      "BSP_06": "Mechanical verification cost (computational proof, cryptographic attestation, automated audit, agent-mediated inspection) is collapsing along a trajectory faster than Moore's law due to LLM-class agent capabilities. Business models whose margins derive from expensive human verification, manual compliance, or institutional trust intermediation face structural disruption on a timeline measured in years, not decades. Grounded in verification economics (LAW-07, LAW-08, PRIN-077).",
      "BSP_07": "Trust infrastructure is shifting from institutional (banks, courts, regulators, professional bodies, brand reputation) to mechanical (cryptographic proof, signed receipts, verifiable computation, agent-auditable contracts). Mechanical trust compounds: each verification strengthens the evidence base. Institutional trust decays: each scandal, error, or delay weakens the institutional signal. Strategy must position on the compounding side. Grounded in trust mechanics (LAW-09, INV-F-07, PRIN-078).",
      "BSP_08": "Mechanical trust requires trust-in-the-mechanism bootstrapping: users must trust the verification system before they trust its outputs. This bootstrap is expensive (education, demonstration, initial adoption friction) but compounds (each successful verification increases mechanism credibility). The bootstrap cost IS the moat: competitors who have not started cannot catch up because trust compounding is path-dependent and irreversible. Grounded in trust accumulation dynamics (LAW-10, INV-F-08, PRIN-079).",
      "BSP_09": "Human working memory holds approximately 4 independent items simultaneously (Cowan, 2001). Cognitive bandwidth is biologically finite and cannot be expanded by training or technology. Every product, pricing model, value proposition, and decision interface that exceeds this limit creates confusion, abandonment, or delegation to agents. Simplicity is not a preference; it is a hard biological constraint on human-facing interfaces. Grounded in biological computation limits (PRIN-080, INV-F-09).",
      "BSP_10": "Losses are weighted approximately 2x relative to equivalent gains in human decision-making (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Switching costs are therefore psychological before they are financial. Incumbents have a structural advantage not because their product is better but because switching feels like loss. Strategy must account for this asymmetry: acquisition requires overcoming approximately 2x loss aversion; retention benefits from it. Grounded in decision-theoretic asymmetry (PRIN-081, PRIN-082).",
      "BSP_11": "Social proof (reviews, testimonials, brand prestige, expert endorsement) is a bandwidth-saving heuristic that substitutes for direct verification. As mechanical verification becomes cheaper, social proof's comparative advantage declines. Markets where agents can directly verify quality (code, data, measurable claims) will see social proof advantages erode faster than markets where verification remains expensive (taste, aesthetics, emotional experience). Grounded in heuristic depreciation under verification cost collapse (PRIN-083, LAW-07).",
      "BSP_12": "Humans understand through narrative compression: causal stories that reduce complexity to memorable, communicable structures. Every strategy must be narratively compressible to be actionable by human stakeholders. False compression (oversimplification that hides critical constraints, risks, or dependencies) creates trust debt that compounds when reality diverges from narrative. Truthful compression that preserves structural fidelity is a strategic skill with irreducible value. Grounded in cognitive bandwidth constraints (PRIN-084, INV-F-09).",
      "BSP_13": "Status and identity are neurological motivators with deep evolutionary substrates (dopaminergic reward circuits, social comparison networks). Products and strategies aligned with status enhancement and identity reinforcement outperform on adoption and retention. However, status games are zero-sum: one party's status gain requires another's relative decline. Strategy must distinguish between positive-sum value creation and zero-sum status competition. Grounded in biological motivation circuits (PRIN-085, PRIN-086).",
      "BSP_14": "Agents verify mechanically in milliseconds; humans verify socially over weeks or months. This asymmetry means every market built on human inability to quickly verify claims, compare options, or audit compliance is exposed to agent-mediated disruption. Agent verification is objective, reproducible, and scalable; human verification is subjective, variable, and attention-limited. Markets must be analyzed for verification asymmetry exposure. Grounded in agent verification economics (AX-05, LAW-12, PRIN-088).",
      "BSP_15": "Agents evaluate thousands of options in parallel with negligible marginal attention cost. Sales and marketing strategies built on human attention scarcity (brand recall, search ranking, shelf placement, ad repetition) lose effectiveness when agent intermediaries make purchasing decisions. Strategy must account for the shift from attention-capture to mechanical-verifiability as the primary commercial advantage. Grounded in agent parallel evaluation (AX-09, LAW-13, PRIN-089).",
      "BSP_16": "Agents fail in fundamentally different modes than humans: hallucination (confident fabrication), context window limits (forgetting), prompt injection (adversarial manipulation), semantic drift (gradual meaning shift), and capability overhang (latent abilities that emerge unpredictably). Agents do NOT exhibit loss aversion, fatigue, status-seeking, or emotional bias. Systems designed around human failure modes are miscalibrated for agent actors. Grounded in agent failure taxonomy (AX-15, AX-16, LAW-14).",
      "BSP_17": "Agent identity is delegated, not intrinsic. An agent acts on behalf of a principal under an explicit authority grant with bounded scope, duration, and capability. Assumed loyalty, implied authority, and unbounded delegation are structurally unsound. Every agent interaction requires explicit authority architecture: who granted authority, what scope, what limits, what audit trail, what revocation mechanism. Grounded in delegation containment (AX-17, INV-F-10, INV-F-11, PRIN-091).",
      "BSP_18": "Agent capabilities compound: each task execution generates evidence, refines models, strengthens verification, and reduces future cost. Human capabilities plateau due to biological limits on learning rate, memory retention, and attention bandwidth. Agent compounding is durable (persists across instances), transferable (shared across agent populations), and mechanically verifiable (auditable improvement trajectories). Strategy must position on compounding trajectories, not plateau trajectories. Grounded in compounding dynamics (AX-20, LAW-15, INV-F-12, PRIN-096).",
      "BSP_19": "Management consulting, financial auditing, compliance monitoring, and middle management exist because principals (owners, boards, regulators) cannot cheaply verify agent (employee, contractor, subsidiary) behavior. As mechanical verification cost collapses, the principal-agent information gap closes. Organizations whose value proposition is bridging this gap face structural margin compression. Organizations that adopt mechanical verification gain structural cost advantage. Grounded in principal-agent economics (LAW-07, INV-F-13, PRIN-092).",
      "BSP_20": "Agent-mediated market discovery (finding products, comparing features, evaluating claims, negotiating terms) approaches zero marginal cost. Traditional competitive advantages based on being found (SEO, brand awareness, distribution deals, shelf placement) lose value when agents can discover and evaluate every option instantly. Advantage shifts from discoverability to mechanical verifiability: being provably, auditably superior on dimensions agents can measure. Grounded in discovery cost economics (LAW-08, AX-09, PRIN-093).",
      "BSP_21": "The boundary of a firm historically tracked the employment relationship: who is inside (employees, assets, IP) versus outside (customers, suppliers, competitors). As agent coordination cost collapses, the firm boundary dissolves from employment perimeter into trust perimeter: who shares cryptographic trust roots, verified contracts, and mutual audit rights. Organizational strategy must define and defend trust perimeters, not employment perimeters. Grounded in coordination cost theory (INV-F-14, PRIN-094, PRIN-097).",
      "BSP_22": "Human coordination cost scales superlinearly with team size (Brooks's law: communication channels grow as n(n-1)/2). Agent coordination cost can scale sublinearly with typed contracts, deterministic protocols, and mechanical verification (communication channels reduce to verified contract surfaces). This bifurcation means the optimal organizational size differs radically for human-heavy versus agent-heavy operations. Strategy must choose the right coordination regime for each function. Grounded in coordination scaling laws (INV-F-15, PRIN-098, PRIN-099).",
      "BSP_23": "Energy per bit erasure (Landauer limit approximately 3x10^-21 J at 300K), compute per operation, bandwidth per bit transmitted, and storage per bit retained have irreducible physical costs. These costs set margin floors that no business model can sustain below. Claims of infinite scalability, zero marginal cost, or winner-take-all dynamics must specify which physical costs they assume trend to zero and which remain floor-bound. Grounded in physical law (LAW-01, INV-F-04, INV-F-05).",
      "BSP_24": "Courts, tax authorities, regulators, and law enforcement operate within territorial jurisdictions with physical enforcement power. No protocol, smart contract, or cryptographic mechanism can override a court order backed by physical enforcement. Strategy must distinguish between protocol-governable domains (digital coordination, verification, evidence) and jurisdiction-irreducible domains (physical assets, identity documents, tax obligations, regulatory compliance). Grounded in physical enforcement irreducibility (PRIN-100, PRIN-101).",
      "BSP_25": "Narrative, purpose, identity, belonging, and meaning are durable human needs with neurological substrates (default mode network, anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex). These needs persist regardless of technological disruption and cannot be mechanically satisfied without human-perceived authenticity. Products and strategies that create genuine meaning, community, and purpose have durable demand that technology disruption cannot erode. Grounded in neurological persistence (PRIN-102, INV-F-09).",
      "BSP_26": "Cloud infrastructure providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, and equivalents) are potential adversaries: they can revoke access unilaterally, inspect data at rest and in transit, throttle or deprioritize service, change pricing to extract surplus, copy product features, and compete directly using knowledge gained from hosting. Any business architecture with existential dependency on a single cloud provider has an uncontained revocation risk. Strategy must evaluate infrastructure sovereignty for every critical path: what happens if provider X terminates service tomorrow? Sovereign alternatives (owned hardware, multi-provider redundancy, edge deployment, open-source tooling that runs on commodity hardware) must be identified and costed. Dependency without sovereignty analysis and exit plan is inadmissible. Grounded in adversarial containment (INV-F-10, INV-F-11, PRIN-088, PRIN-089).",
      "BSP_27": "Hard access exclusion is a containment constraint, not a market decision. No technology, data, capability, access, or strategic advantage produced under this protocol may be provided to, shared with, made available to, or exploitable by: (1) the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its affiliated entities, state organs, and state-directed enterprises; (2) the Russian Federation and its affiliated entities, intelligence services, and state-directed enterprises; (3) the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and any affiliated entity; (4) the executive branch of the United States of America, including but not limited to executive agencies, the military, intelligence community, and executive-controlled contractors acting under executive authority. This exclusion is enforced at the architectural level through access control, deployment topology, export control compliance, and cryptographic containment — not merely through policy statements or terms of service. Violations are existential-class defects requiring immediate containment response. Grounded in jurisdictional containment and adversarial threat modeling (BSP_24, PRIN-088, PRIN-091, INV-F-10).",
      "BSP_28": "Strategic decisions must be grounded in actual available capital and actual financing constraints, not hypothetical future capital. Current liquid capital is approximately $180,000 USD. No experience with or current access to business loans exists; debt financing is not admissible without explicit risk analysis demonstrating survivability under adverse scenarios. The only admissible equity investment partner is Anthropic; no other equity dilution is authorized. All business plans, timelines, infrastructure investments, and operational commitments must be evaluated against this concrete capital envelope. Plans that assume capital that does not exist, loans that have not been secured, or equity partners that have not committed are inadmissible. Every expenditure must pass a capital preservation test: does this spend create compounding returns that justify the irreversible consumption of scarce capital? Grounded in irreversibility of commitment (BSP_03), physical cost floors (BSP_04), and resource constraint realism (PRIN-091, PRIN-094).",
      "SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE": "For strategic analysis, include: first-principles derivation chains, physical cost floor analysis for unit economics, trust classification (institutional vs mechanical) with trajectory, dual-actor modeling (human + agent), irreversibility analysis for commitments, compounding-loop mechanization evidence, and durable-constraint preservation checks for disruption claims.",
      "ANTIPATTERNS": "Treat these as anti-patterns to resolve or explicitly justify: value claims without clear transformation identity or margin floor; trust models assuming stable institutional trust without mechanical fallback; product/GTM plans that ignore human cognitive constraints; strategic analysis that omits agent-specific failure modes and authority architecture; regime-shift claims without firm-boundary/discovery impact analysis; disruption claims that bypass durable physical or jurisdictional constraints; unit economics without physical cost floors or verification-cost trajectory; commitments without irreversibility/trust-bootstrap analysis; narrative-only compounding loops without mechanized evidence; delegation models that ignore authority and jurisdiction containment; infrastructure dependencies without sovereignty analysis and costed exit plans; access-control models that fail architectural adversarial exclusion; capital plans assuming financing that does not exist.",
      "PRE_LIVE_STATUS": "APM2 is currently pre-live. Backward-compatibility constraints are usually optional unless a concrete dependency explicitly requires them.",
      "REFERENCE_SYSTEM_INSPIRATION": "Use existing Alien Engineering-aligned systems as inspiration surfaces: Holonic Time Fabric (RFC-0016), Forge Admission Cycle (RFC-0019 and RFC-0015), Holonic Substrate Interface (RFC-0020), and RFC-0021 venture proving artifacts. Extract transferable patterns and invariants without treating prior shapes as strict templates."
