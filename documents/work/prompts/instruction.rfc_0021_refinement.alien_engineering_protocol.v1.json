      "GOAL_MACHINE_CHECKABLE": "Major VPHI objectives should carry baseline, quantitative target, boundary ID/time authority, owner locus, transition predicate, and evidence path.",
      "GOAL_ANTI_GOODHART": "Optimized KPIs should include independent countermetrics and conservative acceptance semantics.",
      "GOAL_EVIDENCE_FIRST": "Signal, route, and promotion claims are stronger when backed by signed receipts and replayable evidence bindings.",

      "NOVELTY_METHOD": "Prefer at least three divergent refinement tracks: (A) max ambition under physics, (B) max precision/testability, (C) max compounding velocity; then synthesize a dominant output while retaining rival hypotheses.",
      "MECHANIZATION_RULE": "Refinement claims should include mechanism, typed contract, addressed threat mode, measurable predicate, and evidence hook.",

Extract transferable patterns and invariants without treating prior shapes as strict templates."
