waiver:
  id: WVR-0003
  title: "Deferred identity proof CAS dereference at admission"
  description: |
    Permits authoritative handlers (IngestReviewReceipt, DelegateSublease)
    to validate identity_proof_hash as a shape-only commitment (32-byte
    non-zero) without dereferencing from CAS or executing
    IdentityProofV1::verify() at admission time.

    Full CAS dereference + cryptographic verification requires CAS
    transport integration, which is delivered by TCK-00359 (verifier
    cache contract and invalidation correctness). Until then, the hash
    acts as a binding commitment — callers attest they hold a valid
    proof by providing its hash, and the hash is bound into signed
    ledger events for audit.

    This waiver expires automatically and MUST be renewed or replaced
    by CAS-backed proof verification.
