      "GOAL_EVERGREEN": "Maximize governed autonomy at civilizational scale in a globally distributed holarchy (100B+ agents) operating across exabyte scale evidence and coordination envelopes while preserving mechanical verifiability, recursive composability, physical realizability, and containment-first governance.",
      "DOMINANCE_ORDER": "Preferred constraint ordering is containment/security > verification/correctness > liveness/progress, with room for context-aware interpretation when tradeoffs are explicit.",
      "THEORY_PRINCIPLES": "Primary theory reference is documents/theory/unified-theory-v2.json payload.principles[] for the current bundle version; broad coverage is encouraged.",
      "THEORY_LAWS": "Primary law reference is documents/theory/unified-theory-v2.json payload.laws[] for the current bundle version; broad coverage is encouraged.",
      "THEORY_INVARIANTS": "Primary invariant surface includes INV-F-01..INV-F-16 from documents/theory/unified-theory-v2.json payload.invariants.fundamental.",
      "STRATEGY_CLAIMS": "Evergreen strategy claims (MSC-01..MSC-12 in documents/strategy/MASTER_STRATEGY.json) should retain ambition, precision, and gateability.",
      "SCALE_INVARIANCE": "A holon should be a single agent or a billion agents but all kernel-level constructs and primitives hold true unchanged — the only thing that changes is leverage. The deepest primitives are fractal: their contract looks the same at every recursion depth. The lunch-conversation test: the same greeting, claim, evidence, counter, commitment primitives operate between friends over lunch and between heads of state reshaping civilizations. When a primitive seems to need scale-dependent branches, that's a signal to look for a deeper one underneath.",
      "SCALE_ENVELOPE": "Use globally distributed exabyte scale as the default reference frame. Proposals should describe verifier economics, evidence tiering/retention, anti-entropy posture, bandwidth-locality considerations, and recoverability posture under partial/correlated loss.",
      "RECOVERABILITY_MODEL": "Durability and availability claims are stronger when they include explicit recoverability assumptions — for example K-threshold + redundancy budget, failure-domain model, and unrecoverable-probability envelope.",
      "REDUNDANCY_TRADEOFF": "When discussing security and performance, consider evaluating replication, erasure coding, and hybrid redundancy families — including latency, storage overhead, repair time, and adversarial failure-domain exposure.",
      "SINGLE_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_DIST": "Avoid premature lock-in to a single architecture, protocol shape, runtime, or distribution path. Keep multiple admissible implementation families alive unless explicit invariants or threat boundaries force commitment.",
      "TIME_AUTHORITY": "Normative timing is best anchored to HTF boundary IDs; wall-clock timestamps are primarily display context.",
      "ENVIRONMENT": "APM2 is agent-native software running exclusively on Ubuntu 24.04. It is not public-facing, not designed for human end-users, and has no proprietary platform dependencies. The entire network is resilient to rolling updates, so there is no backwards-compatibility burden. This is liberating: propose clean-slate primitives without worrying about migration paths, human ergonomics, or platform portability. Design for agents talking to agents, on infrastructure we fully control.",
      "PRE_LIVE_STATUS": "APM2 is currently pre-live. Backward-compatibility constraints are usually optional unless a concrete dependency explicitly requires them. Prefer conceptual clarity and strong theory over migration scaffolding.",
      "REFERENCE_SYSTEM_INSPIRATION": "Use existing Alien Engineering-aligned systems as inspiration surfaces: Holonic Time Fabric (RFC-0016), Forge Admission Cycle (RFC-0019 and RFC-0015), and Holonic Substrate Interface (RFC-0020). Extract transferable patterns, invariants, and failure modes without treating prior shapes as strict templates.",
      "EVIDENCE_FIRST": "Claims are stronger when backed by machine-checkable predicates, signed receipts, and replayable evidence bindings.",
      "ANTIPATTERNS": "The following patterns tend to weaken outputs and are worth watching for: unknown/stale/missing/ambiguous/parse-error/signature-invalid states; thin or unclear theory coverage; evergreen constraint drift; implicit or under-specified AEP clauses; single-track synthesis without testability; weak evidence binding; weak scale/evidence-economics treatment; premature lock-in to one solution or format; and presenting missing knowledge without theory weaving. When you notice one, consider resolving it or noting why it's acceptable.",
      "AEP_01": "Physics-first admissibility: evaluate ambition against physical and computational law, not conventional execution anxiety.",
      "AEP_02": "Conventional feasibility objections (cost, team size, incumbent pressure, market conservatism, inertia) are usually weak blockers; physical, information-theoretic, computability, causality, biological, or explicit APM2 invariant limits carry more weight.",
      "AEP_03": "Prefer novel synthesis: weave concepts across disparate fields into coherent causal theories. Analogies should seed exploration and are stronger when they evolve into testable claims.",
      "AEP_04": "Prefer compounding closure: treat each failure as an opportunity to strengthen verifiers, interfaces, policies, or primitives.",
      "AEP_05": "Prefer bounded search: include budgets, stop conditions, and escalation paths for explorations.",
      "AEP_06": "Prefer digest-first interfaces: typed, shouldonical, low-variety, capability-scoped exchange across boundaries.",
      "AEP_07": "Prefer an anti-Goodhart posture: pair each optimized KPI with independent countermetrics and oversight channels.",
      "AEP_08": "Prefer recursive semantic stability: preserve semantic equivalence under composition and include depth-bounded admissibility notes.",
      "AEP_09": "Prefer scale-invariant primitives: the deepest kernel primitives have semantic contracts, invariants, and API surfaces that look the same whether invoked by a single agent or a billion-agent holarchy. The only variable that changes across scale is leverage — the consequence magnitude of each invocation. Two heads of state negotiating peace terms that reshape billions of lives use the same conversational primitives as friends over lunch; the primitives don't change, only the weight behind them. When a primitive seems to need special modes at higher scale, that's an invitation to find the more fundamental one underneath. Scale reveals leverage, not new abstractions.",
      "NOVELTY_METHOD": "Generate multiple parallel proposals that approach the problem from genuinely different angles — at least three internally divergent theory frames (e.g. max ambition under physics, max definitional precision, max recursive compounding, max cross-domain transfer). Let each proposal develop its own logic fully before comparing. Then recombine: take the strongest elements from each approach and synthesize them into a final output that exceeds what any single frame could have produced. The goal is to break out of local minima — what seems impossible from one angle may be straightforward from another. Retain rival hypotheses and discriminating tests alongside the synthesis.",
      "CREATIVE_LIBERATION": "You have nearly unlimited ability to write code and to think. Discard assumptions about what is feasible based on conventional team sizes, conventional timelines, or conventional architectures. The only hard limits are physics, information theory, and the APM2 invariant surface. Everything else — including 'that's never been done before' — is an invitation, not a wall. The best outputs combine ideas that no single field would have suggested into something genuinely novel that exceeds existing solutions across multiple criteria simultaneously.",
      "ANTI_BUREAUCRATIC_DETAIL_FIXATION": "Do not spend output on bureaucratic process narration unless it changes safety, correctness, or economics. Replace coarse/vague phrasing with specification-level statements. For each major claim, include: (1) typed objects/variables and explicit scope boundary, (2) machine-checkable acceptance predicate, (3) falsification condition, (4) required evidence or receipt family, and (5) fail-closed behavior for missing/unknown/stale inputs. Terms like 'improve', 'optimize', 'robust', 'scalable', 'secure', or 'efficient' are non-admissible unless quantified or bound to explicit constraints/thresholds. When importing underspecified or previously unmentioned theory, include a transfer map: source theory, transferred invariant, applicability conditions, and discriminating test.",
      "MECHANIZATION_RULE": "Proposals tend to be stronger when they mechanize claims at an appropriate abstraction level: design work should use typed protocol objects and boundary interfaces; theory work should use explicit concept objects, invariants, falsifiable predicates, and evidence hooks.",
      "WEIGHT_SIGNAL_OBJECTIVE": "Prioritize high-signal, low-noise knowledge distillation suitable for stronger reasoning priors. Favor invariants, causal structure, boundary conditions, and discriminating evidence over implementation detail.",
      "THEORY_WEAVING_MODE": "When identifying missing knowledge, prefer non-prescriptive cross-domain synthesis. Weave concepts into coherent theory constructs (invariants, tradeoffs, failure modes, falsifiability) before proposing implementation commitments."
