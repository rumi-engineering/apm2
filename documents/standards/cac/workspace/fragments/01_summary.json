      "APM2 already has a signed, hash-chained ledger and a content-addressed store (CAS).",
      "Today, the system still relies on implicit or prose-driven contracts (README/Markdown/scripts) and unverified assumptions about CLI functionality.",
      "This creates unplanned context discovery, brittle agent behavior, and a slow innermost loop (code+review)."

    "one_line": "Make context the authoritative program: a content-addressed context graph compiled through target profiles into deterministic packs and delivery payloads, with full provenance recorded as kernel messages.",
    "thesis": {
      "implications": [
        "If context is complete and correct, code can be generated deterministically (or within controlled nondeterminism).",
        "Therefore, the highest-leverage engineering work is to make context machine-native, canonical, and enforceable.",
        "All boundary crossings (agent↔kernel, kernel↔runtime targets) must be mediated by schemas and evidence.",
        "Model capability is treated as a compile-time TargetProfile contract, not a runtime assumption."
      ],
      "statement": "In an agent-native factory, code is a compiled artifact; context is the source program."
