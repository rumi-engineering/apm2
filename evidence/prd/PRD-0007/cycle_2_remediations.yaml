      root_cause: |
        The emergency override protocol creates multiple deadlock scenarios:
        1. Kernel cannot emit audit events during bootstrap failure (circular dependency)
        2. External audit sink failure blocks override, creating permanent unavailability
        3. All tiers of recovery can fail simultaneously with no ultimate fallback

      proposed_remediation:

          Add degraded audit mode and ultimate fallback to CNS-0006 recovery procedure.

             - Verify emergency override proceeds with local buffering
             - Verify buffer integrity via HMAC verification
             - Verify buffer delivery on recovery

             - Verify state export completes successfully
             - Verify no state mutations permitted in TIER_4

          3. Add bootstrap-safe-mode test: Verify emergency override audit emission
             without full kernel operational

      vote: SUPPORT
      vote_rationale: |
        This remediation provides three critical improvements:

        1. Degraded audit mode breaks the SA2-M49-F001 deadlock by allowing temporary
           operation with local buffering when external sink is unreachable. The 30-minute
           threshold and 72-hour limit provide reasonable bounds.

        2. Bootstrap-safe-mode audit resolves SA1-M1-F001 circular dependency by providing
           a minimal audit path that doesn't require full kernel operation.

        3. TIER_4 (Dead Man's Switch) addresses SA3-M39-F001 by providing an ultimate fallback
           when all other recovery tiers fail. READ_ONLY_ARCHIVE mode is appropriate - it
           prevents data loss while acknowledging the system cannot recover automatically.

        The remediation is minimal and testable. It doesn't over-engineer the solution but
        provides necessary escape hatches for catastrophic scenarios.

        - SA3-M55-F001
      root_cause: |
        The escalation policy creates misaligned incentives:
        1. Agents have incentive to escalate frequently (no cost to agent)
        2. Authorities face social pressure to approve (unblock work)
        3. Escalation frequency metric creates negative signal, suppressing visibility
        4. Nash equilibrium: agents always escalate, authorities always approve, packs never improve

      proposed_remediation:
        description: |
          Decompose escalation metrics and introduce escalation cost structure to align incentives.
          This creates negative feedback loops that make escalation creep economically unviable
          while still allowing legitimate escalations.

      vote: SUPPORT
      vote_rationale: |
        This remediation directly addresses the game-theoretic failure modes:

        1. Escalation budget (max 2 per work item) creates cost for agents, preventing
           unbounded escalation. Third escalation requiring AUTH_PRODUCT raises stakes
           appropriately.

        2. Consequence binding creates accountability feedback - authorities are more
           likely to deny frivolous escalations if they're responsible for follow-up.

        3. Recurrence policy (dual-signoff for repeated stable_id) prevents authorities
           from repeatedly approving known pack gaps without DOMAIN_COMPILER involvement.

        4. Decomposing escalation metrics into deficiency vs. novel distinguishes signal
           from noise, resolving SA1-M43-F001. Pack deficiency triggers fix, novel use
           cases inform evolution.

        The Nash equilibrium shifts: escalation is no longer always dominant strategy
        because it has cost. Authorities have incentive to deny frivolous escalations
        due to accountability. This aligns incentives with desired outcomes.

      title: "Hash Collision Bypass - Dependency Review Trust Boundary"
      finding_id: SA1-M8-F001
      root_cause: |
        BLAKE3-256 provides 128-bit collision resistance. An attacker with O(2^128) work
        can generate two artifacts with same hash, bypassing dependency review by submitting
        benign artifact for review, then substituting malicious artifact with same hash
        before compilation. While currently infeasible, PRD claims "algorithm agility"

      vote_rationale: |
        This remediation is appropriately scoped:

        1. Asserts explicit collision resistance requirement (≥256-bit) without requiring
           immediate hash algorithm change. BLAKE3-256 is adequate for initial deployment.

        2. Adds monitoring and upgrade policy to address long-term concern. The 5-year
           warning provides adequate lead time for coordinated upgrade.

        3. Links to existing algorithm agility property (SEC-PROP-0005), making this a
           clarification rather than new requirement.

        The remediation acknowledges the theoretical vulnerability while providing
        practical mitigation. Immediate hash algorithm change would be over-engineering
        given O(2^128) infeasibility with current technology. Monitoring + upgrade policy
        is the minimal effective response.

        This remediation closes the race condition vulnerability:

        1. Distributed lock with GLOBAL scope prevents concurrent ceremony initiation.
           Even if an attacker compromises single authority key, they cannot initiate
           multiple ceremonies simultaneously.

        2. Lock acquisition is atomic (acquire before generating ceremony_start_timestamp),
           preventing TOCTOU races between ceremony initiation and lock acquisition.

        3. Lock timeout (15 minutes) matches ceremony window, ensuring locks don't persist
           indefinitely if ceremony fails.

        4. Verification that signoffs correspond to active ceremony prevents accepting
           signoffs for expired/invalid ceremonies.

        The remediation is minimal: adds ~20 lines to ceremony_procedure specifying lock
        semantics. Implementation can use existing distributed lock primitives (e.g.,
        Redis SETNX, etcd lease). This is a standard distributed systems pattern applied
        to ceremony coordination.

      title: "Deontic Gap - No Obligation to Act Post-Override"
      finding_id: SA3-M65-F001
      root_cause: |
        Emergency override protocol specifies PERMISSION to override (triple-signoff
        requirements) and audit requirements, but does NOT specify OBLIGATION to act
        after override is used. Without explicit obligation assignment, the audit trail
        exists but no one is obligated to investigate, remediate, or report. This is
        a deontic gap: permission without obligation creates accountability vacuum.

      proposed_remediation:
        description: |
          Add post-override obligation protocol specifying WHO is obligated to act,
          WHAT actions are required, and WHEN they must be completed. This closes
          the accountability loop.

        This remediation closes the deontic gap comprehensively:

        1. Immediate obligations (OBL-OVERRIDE-001, OBL-OVERRIDE-002) ensure incident
           investigation starts within hours, not days or weeks. 4-hour deadline for
           AUTH_SECURITY is aggressive but appropriate for emergency scenarios.

        2. Investigation obligation (OBL-OVERRIDE-003) with 72-hour deadline ensures
           detailed analysis completes while incident is fresh.

        3. Governance obligation (OBL-OVERRIDE-004) ensures DOMAIN_GOVERNANCE reviews
           and decides on corrective actions. This is where obligation converts to
           process improvement.

        4. Recurrence obligation (OBL-OVERRIDE-005) escalates to board if override
           is used repeatedly, preventing normalization of emergency procedures.

        5. Prohibition (PROH-OVERRIDE-001) prevents using override as regular recovery
           mechanism without addressing root cause.

        The enforcement mechanism (MAJOR defect for missed deadlines, CRITICAL for
        recurrence) creates teeth. This is minimal but effective: adds explicit
        obligations without over-engineering the incident management process.

      All remediations follow minimal change principle:
      - MERGED-BLOCKER-001: Adds degraded modes and fallback tiers without restructuring recovery
      - MERGED-BLOCKER-002: Adds cost structure and metric decomposition to existing policy

    rationale: |
      All 5 BLOCKER findings have concrete, minimal, testable remediations proposed.
      Council aggregator votes SUPPORT for all 5 remediations. Next step is for
      subagents (SA-1, SA-2, SA-3) to vote on each remediation in Cycle 3.

    cycle_3_focus:
      - "Subagent vote on each of 5 remediations (SUPPORT/OPPOSE/ABSTAIN)"
      - "Quorum threshold: 2-of-3 SUPPORT required for approval"
      - "If all remediations reach quorum, verdict = PASSED"
      - "If any remediation fails quorum, escalate to AUTH_PRODUCT for tie-breaking"
