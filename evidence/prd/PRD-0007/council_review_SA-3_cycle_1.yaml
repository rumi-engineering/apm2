    title: "Incomplete causal chain from defect aggregation to pack improvement"
    description: |
      The feedback loop (04_solution_overview.yaml lines 311-346) describes defect aggregation
      triggers (TRIGGER-SIGNATURE-THRESHOLD, TRIGGER-ESCALATION-FREQUENCY) but does not specify
      WHO executes the pack spec review, WHAT process they follow, or HOW pack spec updates
      are generated. The causal chain terminates at "PACK_SPEC_REVIEW_NEEDED event" without
      specifying the downstream process. This creates a gap where defects aggregate but may
      not translate to improvements.

      Causal gap identified:
      DefectRecord → Aggregation → Trigger Event → [MISSING: Review Process] → Pack Update

      Without explicit process ownership and decision criteria, the feedback loop may become
      a data sink rather than an improvement driver.
    location: "04_solution_overview.yaml:311-346 (feedback_loop section)"
    remediation: |
      Add to feedback_loop section:
      - Explicit process owner (e.g., DOMAIN_COMPILER team or AGENT_AUTHOR role)
      - Review decision criteria (what constitutes a valid pack update vs. noise)
      - Automated pack spec generation guidelines (if machine-authored)
      - Human review gates (if semi-automated)
      - Success criteria for pack updates (how to verify improvement)

      Consider adding a new artifact kind: defect_aggregation.report that triggers
      automated pack spec patch generation with human-in-the-loop approval.

      SEC-CTRL-0012 (06_constraints_invariants.yaml lines 418-423) requires AATReceipts to be
      cryptographically bound to binary hash, but does not specify HOW selftests verify that
      the capability manifest accurately reflects reality. The causal chain assumes:

      Binary → Selftest → AATReceipt → Capability Manifest Accuracy

      However, if selftests are incomplete or test the wrong invariants, the AATReceipt may
      pass while the capability manifest remains inaccurate. The causal mechanism for ensuring
      test coverage completeness is missing.
    location: "06_constraints_invariants.yaml:418-423 (SEC-CTRL-0012)"
    remediation: |
      Add requirement for capability manifest coverage analysis:
      - Each declared capability MUST have at least one acceptance test
      - AATReceipts MUST include coverage map: capability_id → test_id[]
      - Admission of capability manifest updates MUST verify coverage map completeness
      - Add guardrail: "Capability declarations without test coverage are rejected"

      This closes the causal loop by ensuring the verification mechanism (AAT) actually
      tests what it claims to test.

    title: "Graduated enforcement acceleration clause may create unintended causal pressure"
    description: |
      TRADEOFF-0001 includes an acceleration clause (08_risks_questions.yaml lines 198-200):
      "If MET-0002 (pack completeness) >85% at week 5, advance to HARD_FAIL at week 6."

      This creates a causal pressure where teams may game MET-0002 (by avoiding difficult
      work items or escalating more frequently) to delay HARD_FAIL enforcement. The causal
      chain is:

      High pack completeness metric → Early HARD_FAIL → Increased friction

      Therefore: Teams have incentive to keep pack completeness below 85% until week 7.

      This inverts the intended causality and may lead to strategic underperformance.
    location: "08_risks_questions.yaml:198-200 (acceleration_clause)"
    remediation: |
      Revise acceleration clause to use leading indicators resistant to gaming:
      - Use "defect pattern diversity" (more stable) instead of raw completeness rate
      - Add requirement: "Sample must include ≥3 different work types with difficulty ≥MEDIUM"
      - Include confidence interval: "Upper bound of 80% CI must exceed 85%"

      Alternative: Use acceleration only if BOTH completeness ≥85% AND miss rate <0.3 per run.
      This makes gaming harder by requiring dual metric satisfaction.

      CNS-0006 (06_constraints_invariants.yaml lines 48-252) provides extensive recovery
      procedures for bootstrap failures, but does not address the counterfactual:

      "What if the recovery procedures themselves fail or are unavailable?"

      Specific scenario: All three primary authorities are unavailable, TIER_2 degraded
      operations have been active for 24 hours, and TIER_3 board escalation is triggered.
      But what if the board CANNOT reach consensus within the 24-hour SLA (lines 208-209)?

      The PRD provides tiered recovery but no ultimate fallback when all tiers fail. This
      creates an unbounded deadlock scenario where the system is permanently frozen.
    location: "06_constraints_invariants.yaml:48-252 (CNS-0006 recovery_procedure)"
    remediation: |
      Add TIER_4 (Dead Man's Switch) protocol:
      - If TIER_3 exceeds 48 hours without resolution, system enters READ_ONLY_ARCHIVE mode
      - All state is exported to content-addressed cold storage
      - External audit receives cryptographic proof-of-state snapshot
      - Human operator can initiate offline manual recovery with >72-hour latency expectation

      Add explicit SLA ceiling: "If bootstrap recovery exceeds 72 hours, system is considered
      permanently compromised and requires cold-start rebuild from last known-good checkpoint."

    title: "Counterfactual gap: What if dependency provenance review is compromised at review time?"

      CNS-0010 (06_constraints_invariants.yaml lines 278-286) requires pack specs to include
      author_identity and admission_receipt_hash for each dependency, and warns if author_identity
      is not on approved producer list. However, this does not address the counterfactual:

      "What if the approved producer list itself is compromised or injected at review time?"

      The security model assumes the approved producer list is trustworthy, but if an adversary
      can inject malicious entries into the approved list before pack spec review, the provenance
      check becomes meaningless. The PRD does not specify:
      - Who controls the approved producer list
      - How the list is versioned and admitted
      - Whether the list itself requires provenance review

      This creates a circular dependency: pack specs depend on approved producer list, but
      how is the approved producer list itself governed?
    location: "06_constraints_invariants.yaml:278-286 (CNS-0010)"
    remediation: |
      Add requirement for approved producer list governance:

      - List updates MUST be admitted via PatchRecord with AUTH_SECURITY signoff
      - Pack spec reviews MUST pin the approved_producer_list_hash at review time
      - Compilation MUST verify pack spec was reviewed against the same approved producer list version

      - How test vectors are initially seeded

      If test vectors drift, the entire canonicalization foundation breaks.

    title: "Misaligned incentives in escalation policy create escalation creep"
    description: |
      The escalation.policy artifact kind (04_solution_overview.yaml lines 257-265) allows
      consumption holons to escalate pack misses with authorization, but the governance structure
      creates a principal-agent problem:

      - Agents (consumption holons) have incentive to escalate frequently to avoid task failure
      - Authorities (authorization roles) face social pressure to approve escalations to unblock work
      - Pack compiler team receives escalation_count_metric feedback, but has no direct authority
        to deny escalations or enforce pack improvement

      Game-theoretic analysis:
      Nash equilibrium: Agents always escalate, authorities always approve, pack specs never improve.

      The current design lacks negative feedback for excessive escalation. Escalation is a
      dominant strategy because it has no cost to the agent requesting it.
    location: "04_solution_overview.yaml:257-265 (escalation.policy)"
    remediation: |
      Introduce escalation cost structure to align incentives:

      1. Escalation budget: Each work item has max 2 escalations. Third escalation requires
         higher authority (AUTH_PRODUCT) and creates MAJOR defect.

      2. Escalation consequence binding: If an escalation is approved, the authority_role
         who approved it MUST be tagged in the subsequent pack spec improvement task. This
         creates accountability.

      3. Escalation recurrence penalty: If the same stable_id is escalated ≥2 times within
         14 days (per TRIGGER-ESCALATION-FREQUENCY), subsequent escalations for that stable_id
         require dual-signoff (authority + DOMAIN_COMPILER).

      4. Pack improvement SLA binding: Escalation approval MUST include expected fix timeline.
         If timeline is missed, escalation authority is notified and must re-approve or deny
         future escalations for that stable_id.

      These mechanisms create negative feedback loops that make escalation creep economically
      unviable while still allowing legitimate escalations.

    title: "Graduated enforcement rollout incentivizes strategic delay"
    description: |
      The graduated enforcement rollout (TRADEOFF-0001, 08_risks_questions.yaml lines 188-196)
      creates a game-theoretic timing problem:

      - Weeks 1-3: WARN mode (no enforcement)
      - Weeks 4-6: SOFT_FAIL mode (high-severity only)
      - Weeks 7-8: HARD_FAIL mode (all violations block)

      Strategic agents can optimize by:
      - Deferring difficult work until WARN mode to avoid pack improvement pressure
      - Completing high-priority work in SOFT_FAIL mode before HARD_FAIL arrives
      - Stockpiling escalations in week 6 to consume during week 7-8

      This creates a "cramming" pattern where pack improvement work is delayed until week 6,
      resulting in a spike of incomplete pack specs right before HARD_FAIL. The PRD does not
      address this strategic behavior.
    location: "08_risks_questions.yaml:188-196 (rollout_phases)"
    remediation: |
      Modify rollout to remove advance warning and introduce stochastic enforcement:

      Option 1: Probabilistic enforcement
      - Week 1-2: 10% of violations fail (random sample)
      - Week 3-4: 30% of violations fail
      - Week 5-6: 60% of violations fail
      - Week 7+: 100% of violations fail

      Random sampling removes predictability and forces continuous pack improvement.

      Option 2: Work-type stratification
      - HIGH_PRIORITY work types enter HARD_FAIL immediately
      - MEDIUM_PRIORITY work types follow graduated schedule
      - LOW_PRIORITY work types have extended WARN period

      This prevents "cherry-picking" of easy work during lenient periods.

      Option 3 (Recommended): No-advance-notice enforcement
      - Do not publicly announce enforcement schedule
      - Enforcement level is determined per-work-item based on pack completeness for that work type
      - Once a work type achieves 90% completeness, it enters HARD_FAIL for all future work

      This creates continuous pressure for improvement without strategic gaming opportunities.

      harness and reflects what the CLI/kernel actually supports. However, the PRD does not
      specify WHO is responsible for maintaining comprehensive selftest coverage.

      Game-theoretic issue: Capability manifest completeness is a public good. Individual
      contributors have weak incentive to add tests for capabilities they don't personally use,
      but strong incentive to free-ride on others' test contributions.

      Result: Capability manifest may have incomplete coverage, with edge-case capabilities
      untested. Agents discover missing capabilities at runtime rather than planning time,
      defeating the purpose of the capability manifest.
    location: "04_solution_overview.yaml:138-141 (ENT-CAP)"
    remediation: |
      Introduce capability coverage accountability mechanism:

      1. Each CLI command MUST declare its capability surface via structured comment
      2. AAT harness generates coverage report: declared_capabilities vs tested_capabilities
      3. AATReceipt includes capability_coverage_ratio (tested/declared)
      4. GATE-CAC-CUTOVER requires capability_coverage_ratio ≥95%
      5. CLI command PRs are blocked unless capability tests are included

      Additionally, introduce negative signal: If agents experience runtime capability failure
      for a capability NOT in the manifest, emit DefectRecord targeting the AAT test suite
      author (identified via git blame of test/cac/aat/).

      This converts the public good problem into a private accountability problem.

      4. OBLIGATION: DOMAIN_COMPILER MUST review PACK_QUALITY_OBJECTION within 24 hours

      2. Add buffer: Extend timeline to 12 weeks (50% buffer) or make timeline adaptive:

      3. Pre-mortem analysis: Add section "What could go wrong?" with specific scenarios:
         - Pack compiler has bugs delaying improvements
         - Defect aggregation produces too many false positives

      3. Falsification attempt: Explicitly search for counterexamples: "What problems would
         CAC NOT solve that are currently pain points?" Add to non_goals if found.

      4. Diverse stakeholder input: Survey consumers of APM2 system (agents, humans, downstream
         systems) to identify pain points independently. Compare with FM-0001 through FM-0005
         to check for availability bias blind spots.

      5. Add EVID-0016: "Historical failure mode frequency analysis showing FM-0001 through
         FM-0005 represent ≥80% of recent incidents by severity-weighted count."

      This provides empirical grounding for problem prioritization.

    title: "Confirmation bias in alternative intervention assessment"
    description: |
      Each observed_failure_mode (02_problem.yaml lines 33-139) includes alternative_interventions
      with assessments that consistently conclude CAC is superior. This pattern suggests
      confirmation bias: alternatives are framed to make CAC appear superior rather than
      genuinely evaluated.

      Examples:
      - ALT-FM001-01: "Addresses symptom but not cause" (line 44)
      - ALT-FM002-02: "Tests verify behavior exists but do not expose capabilities to agents" (line 69)
      - ALT-FM003-01: "Detective only; does not prevent" (line 87)

      All alternatives are dismissed with similar reasoning: "CAC is preventative/canonical,
      alternatives are detective/symptomatic." This suggests the evaluation was not independent
      but rather designed to justify a pre-determined conclusion.

      Epistemic hygiene issue: Are these assessments accurate, or are they rationalization
      of a decision already made?
    location: "02_problem.yaml:33-139 (alternative_interventions within each FM)"
    remediation: |
      Apply double-blind alternative evaluation:

      1. Independent assessment: Have someone NOT involved in CAC design evaluate alternatives
         using the same criteria. Compare results.

      2. Steelman alternatives: For each alternative intervention, describe the STRONGEST
         version of that approach (not weakest). Example: "Comprehensive CLI documentation"
         becomes "Machine-readable API contracts with integration tests and continuous validation."

      3. Hybrid approaches: Consider whether CAC + alternatives is better than CAC alone.
         Example: CAC for canonical storage + strict Markdown linting for vendor exports
         may be superior to CAC alone.

      4. Quantified comparison: Use explicit scoring matrix:
         - Cost (implementation effort)
         - Effectiveness (problem reduction)
         - Risk (failure modes)
         - Reversibility (ease of rollback)
         Assign numerical scores (1-5) for each alternative and CAC.

      5. Add EVID-0017: "Independent evaluation of alternatives by stakeholder not involved
         in CAC design, confirming CAC superiority claims."

      This debiases the alternative evaluation by forcing rigorous comparison.

    title: "Anchoring bias in success metrics baselines"
    description: |
      Success metrics (05_success_metrics.yaml) use baseline expectations that appear to be
      anchored on unstated assumptions:

      - MET-0001: "expected >50 per 1000 work items" (line 8)
      - MET-0002: "expected <50% initially" (line 16)
      - MET-0005: "Expected >30% rejection rate in first 30 days" (line 40)

      These baselines are stated without empirical justification, suggesting anchoring bias:
      the author picked numbers that felt reasonable without measuring current state.

      Epistemic concern: If actual baseline is significantly different (e.g., current unplanned
      reads are 200 per 1000, not 50), the target improvement may be too optimistic or too
      conservative.
    location: "05_success_metrics.yaml:1-93 (metrics section)"
    remediation: |
      Remove anchoring by measuring current state:

      1. BEFORE CAC rollout, measure current baseline for MET-0001 through MET-0007 using
         existing instrumentation (if available) or add temporary instrumentation.

      2. Update baseline fields with actual measured values and confidence intervals, not
         expectations.

      3. If measurement is not feasible pre-rollout, change baseline to: "Baseline will be
         established from first 30 days post-deployment. Target will be adjusted based on
         measured baseline using formula: target = baseline * 0.8 (i.e., 20% improvement)."

      4. Add requirement: MET-0001 through MET-0007 baselines MUST be measured and recorded
         as evidence artifacts within 30 days of rollout.

      This removes anchoring by forcing empirical baseline establishment.

    title: "Survivorship bias in AAT receipt gating"
    description: |
      GATE-CAC-CUTOVER (13_governance_model.yaml lines 48-55) requires AATReceipt to be
      "recent and passing" but does not specify:
      - What happens to failed AAT receipts?
      - Are they stored and analyzed?
      - Is there a feedback mechanism?

      This creates potential survivorship bias: only passing receipts are visible, so patterns
      in failing tests may be invisible. Decision-makers see only success, not near-misses
      or recurring failures.

      Epistemic risk: If AAT test suite has blind spots (e.g., capability X always fails but
      is rarely needed), those blind spots remain invisible because failed receipts are not
      systematically analyzed.
    location: "13_governance_model.yaml:48-55 (GATE-CAC-CUTOVER)"
    remediation: |
      Add failed AAT receipt analysis requirement:

      1. ALL AAT runs (passing and failing) MUST emit receipts stored in CAS
      2. Failed AAT receipts MUST be tagged with failure_reason_category
      3. AAT failure dashboard tracks:
         - Failure frequency by capability
         - Time-to-fix for failed capabilities
         - Recurring failure patterns
      4. GATE-CAC-CUTOVER additionally requires:
         - No BLOCKER-severity AAT failures in past 7 days
         - AAT failure rate <5% over past 30 days
         - All recurring failures (≥3 times) have assigned owners

      This eliminates survivorship bias by making failures first-class data.

    PRD-0007 (Context-as-Code) is strongly aligned with Phase 1: Recursive Self-Improvement.

    DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS (P1 = 0.85):
    - Addresses core P1 objective: "Achieve recursive improvement until the system generates
      better software than unaugmented humans"
    - Success metrics directly target P1 key metrics:
      * MET-0006: PR cycle time (maps to "Review efficiency")
      * MET-0007: Defect recurrence rate (maps to "Bug introduction rate")
      * Hermetic consumption enables higher autonomy (maps to "Autonomy level")
    - Feedback loop (defect aggregation → pack improvement) is recursive improvement incarnate
    - Measurable throughput gains (G-0007) create data for monotonic improvement tracking

    ENABLING CONTRIBUTIONS:
    - P2 (Innovation): 0.35 - CAC provides foundation for novel method generation by making
      context machine-native, but does not directly generate novel methods. Score reflects
      enabling contribution only.
    - P3 (Enterprise): 0.20 - Target delivery pipeline and vendor interoperability support
      future enterprise partnerships, but no direct revenue or customer work in this PRD.
    - P4 (Partnership): 0.15 - Minimal direct contribution. Provenance and audit trails
      support future corporate partnerships requiring compliance/security, but this is
      preparatory, not active.
    - P5 (Life Sciences): 0.10 - No direct contribution. Improved agent quality could
      eventually accelerate life sciences work, but this is too far downstream to score higher.

    PHASE ALIGNMENT BREAKDOWN:
    - Primary: P1 (recursive improvement via feedback loops and measurable quality gains)
    - Secondary: P2 (enabling future innovation through better context substrate)
    - No phase blockers identified.

  strategic_recommendations:
    - |
      PHASE ACCELERATION (P1): To maximize P1 impact, prioritize MET-0007 (defect recurrence)
      over MET-0006 (cycle time). Defect recurrence directly measures recursive improvement
      (system learns from mistakes), while cycle time is a lagging indicator. Consider adding
      metric: "Time-to-pack-fix after defect pattern detection" as a leading indicator of
      recursive improvement loop health.

    - |
      CROSS-PHASE SYNERGY (P1 + P2): Add explicit mechanism for capturing agent-discovered
      context patterns as innovation seeds. When defect aggregation reveals novel context
      organization strategies, emit those as candidate innovations for P2 evaluation. This
      converts operational improvement (P1) into methodological innovation (P2).

    - |
      CROSS-PHASE SYNERGY (P1 + P3): Target delivery pipeline (vendor layouts) should be
      positioned as enterprise-ready export capability from day 1. Add explicit requirement
      for enterprise compliance features (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA context classification). This
      prepares P3 groundwork while executing P1 work.

    - |
      RISK MITIGATION (P2/P3): Avoid over-constraining context representation to current
      APM2-specific needs. Ensure CAC-JSON schema is extensible enough to support future
      non-APM2 use cases (potential P3 product offerings). Add constraint: "Schema evolution
      MUST support cross-organization namespaces for future partnership/licensing scenarios."

    - |
      RISK MITIGATION (P1): Graduated enforcement schedule (TRADEOFF-0001) should be
      data-driven rather than time-driven. Replace fixed timeline with adaptive triggers
      based on MET-0002 and MET-0003 thresholds. This ensures P1 recursive improvement is
      actually working before enforcing hermeticity, reducing risk of premature optimization.

  violations: []
  violations_rationale: |
    No North Star violations detected:
    - NOT PHASE_REGRESSION: PRD does not undo progress in any completed phase.
    - NOT PHASE_SKIP: PRD is appropriately focused on P1 with P2 groundwork; no attempt to
      skip ahead to P3/P4/P5 without prerequisites.
    - NOT MISSION_DRIFT: All goals are clearly aligned with recursive improvement (P1 core mission).
    - NOT VALUE_EXTRACTION: No evidence of short-term optimization at long-term mission expense.
      The graduated enforcement approach explicitly balances short-term velocity with long-term
      quality, showing mission alignment.

    HOWEVER: Several findings (SA3-M55-F001, SA3-M55-F002) identify incentive misalignments
    that, if not remediated, could lead to VALUE_EXTRACTION patterns (gaming metrics instead
    of improving system). These are flagged as BLOCKER/MAJOR severity to prevent future
    North Star violations.

      Debiasing analysis (Mode 80) is inherently subjective. Confidence is MEDIUM because
      bias detection requires inferring author intent from document structure. Findings
      SA3-M80-F001 through SA3-M80-F005 are well-supported by textual evidence but could
      be alternatively explained by author's writing style rather than cognitive bias.
      However, the remediations (empirical grounding, independent evaluation) are valuable
      regardless of whether bias is present.
  overall_confidence: HIGH
  limitations:
    - |
      This review cycle (cycle 1) did not examine all 15 requirements or all 15 evidence
      artifacts in detail. Findings focus on core PRD structure and may miss requirement-specific
      issues.
    - |
      Mode 55 (game-theoretic) analysis assumes rational agents optimizing individual utility.
      If agents are cooperative or bound by strong social norms, incentive misalignments may
      be less severe than modeled.
    - |
      North Star assessment assumes current state is P1 (recursive improvement). If organization
      is actually in transition between phases, scores may need adjustment.
