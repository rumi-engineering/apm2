  verdict:
    status: NEEDS_REMEDIATION
    confidence: HIGH
    quorum_achieved: true
    reason: |
      PRD-0005 passed all structural gates. GATE-PRD-CONTENT identified 47 findings
      (0 BLOCKER, 32 MAJOR). Council achieved unanimous quorum on 8 remediation proposals.
      PRD will achieve PASSED status once remediations are applied.

      Note: Metrics baselines (REM-005) deferred until system operational.

  next_steps:
    - "Apply structural remediations (REM-001 through REM-004, REM-006 through REM-008)"
    - "Re-run GATE-PRD-SCHEMA and GATE-PRD-LINT after edits"
    - "Proceed to AUTH_PRODUCT and AUTH_SECURITY signoff"
    - "Defer REM-005 (metric baselines) until post-MVP operational data available"

  deferred_items:
    - item: "Success metric baselines and calibration plans"
      reason: "Metrics unavailable until Idea Compiler is operational"
      remediation_id: REM-005
      resume_trigger: "After 30 compile runs establish baseline data"
