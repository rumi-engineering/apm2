verdict: APPROVED
verdict_reason: |
  RFC-0013 v2 is ready for advancement to v4 (Standard). All 9 gates PASSED with only
  4 MINOR findings remaining. Zero BLOCKER and zero MAJOR findings.

  Key accomplishments in v2:
  1. All 4 critical open questions (OQ-DAEMON-001 through OQ-DAEMON-004) resolved with
     evidence-backed architecture decisions
  2. SA3-F-011 cousin violation resolved via AD-LAYER-001 layering model
  3. Previous 9 MAJOR findings from v2 review addressed
  4. Security posture strengthened with AD-KEY-001 (key lifecycle) and AD-VERIFY-001
     (canonicalization)

  Remaining v4 work:
  1. Address 4 MINOR findings (path correction, event vocabulary, proto stub, network ns)
  2. Update 00_meta.yaml version to v4
  3. Proceed to DECOMPOSE mode for ticket generation
