verdict: APPROVED_WITH_REMEDIATION
verdict_reason: |
  RFC-0013 v2 (Grounded) demonstrates sound architectural design with no BLOCKER findings.
  All 9 gates PASSED structurally. The v0 cousin violation (SA3-F-011) is properly resolved
  via AD-LAYER-001 layering model.

  9 MAJOR findings require remediation before v4 finalization:
  1. Missing DBus/cgroup dependency (SA2-F-001)
  2. Missing proto/daemon_protocol.proto (SA2-F-003)
  3. Telemetry accuracy gate unrealistic (SA2-F-006)
  4. HarnessAdapter interface mismatch (SA2-F-007)
  5. Signing key lifecycle incomplete (SA3-F-001)
  6. Receipt verification predicate not implementable (SA3-F-003)
  7. Capability manifest hash binding missing (SA3-F-006)
  8. Missing doctrine traceability (SA1-F-006)
  9. Cross-crate DefectRecord dependency unclear (SA1-F-004)

  RFC is ready for v4 (Finalization) phase after addressing these remediations.
