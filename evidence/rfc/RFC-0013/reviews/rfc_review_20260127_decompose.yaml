verdict: APPROVED
verdict_reason: |
  RFC-0013 DECOMPOSE mode completed successfully. All 9 gates PASSED.
  Generated 22 implementation-ready tickets (TCK-00156 through TCK-00177).

  Key outcomes:
  1. Scaffolding ticket (TCK-00156) added to create module structure
  2. All 8 derived requirements covered by tickets
  3. Critical path depth: 10 tickets
  4. 3 parallelizable tracks identified for execution efficiency
  5. AD-LAYER-001 cousin resolution preserved in ticket design
