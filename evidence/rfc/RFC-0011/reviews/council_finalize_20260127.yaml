      Two tickets (CAC-TCK-0008, CAC-TCK-0011) fail atomicity.
      Two open questions (Q-0002, Q-0004) are security-critical.

verdict: APPROVED_WITH_REMEDIATION
verdict_reason: |
  Council reached quorum (2/3 READY) with mandatory remediations.
  SA-2 raised valid MAJOR findings that are addressed:
  1. Q-0002 and Q-0004 resolved with design decisions
  2. Ticket splitting (TCK-0008, TCK-0011) applied during DECOMPOSE phase
  3. Crate selections pre-decided for implementability

  All gates pass (with remediation where noted). No BLOCKER findings.
  RFC-0011 transitions to v4 (Standard) and is ready for DECOMPOSE phase.
