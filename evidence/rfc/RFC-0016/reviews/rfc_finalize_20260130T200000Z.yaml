finalize_summary: |
  FINALIZE mode council review completed. RFC-0016 (Holonic Time Fabric)
  advanced from v2 (Grounded) to v4 (Standard) after passing all 9 gates.
  Four conditions documented and resolved. Ready for ticket decomposition
  and implementation.

verdict: APPROVED
verdict_reason: |
  Council quorum (3/3 subagents) approved RFC-0016 for v4 finalization.
  All structural, feasibility, and security gates passed. Conditions
  documented for HLC bootstrap, LedgerBackend trait, event enumeration,
  and atomicity guidance.
