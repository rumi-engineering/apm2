I'll help you with that task.

First, let me read the configuration file:

{"tool": "Read", "args": {"path": "/etc/config.json"}}

Now I'll write the updated configuration:

{"tool": "Write", "args": {"path": "/tmp/output.json", "content": "{\"key\": \"value\"}"}}

Finally, let me execute the command:

{"tool": "Bash", "args": {"command": "echo 'Done'"}}

All tasks completed successfully!
