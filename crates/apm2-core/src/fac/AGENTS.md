# Forge Admission Cycle (fac) Module

> Evidence gates, projection compromise detection, and admission policy enforcement.

## Overview

The `apm2_core::fac` module defines control-plane safety logic for admission and
projection integrity. It enforces fail-closed security checks around boundary
decisions, emits signed evidence for critical state transitions, and keeps
authoritative outcomes pinned to CAS+ledger trust roots.

This module includes RFC-0028 REQ-0009 controls for projection compromise
detection, quarantine, and replay recovery.

## projection_compromise Submodule

The `projection_compromise` submodule implements compromise handling for public
projection surfaces.

### Key Types

- `ProjectionCompromiseError`: Fail-closed error taxonomy for compromise,
  quarantine, and replay-recovery paths.
- `ProjectionChannel`: Projection endpoint descriptor with expected digest and
  quarantine status.
- `ProjectionDivergence`: Digest-bound divergence evidence used to justify
  containment.
- `ProjectionCompromiseSignalV1`: Signed quarantine signal carrying temporal
  authority bindings (`time_authority_ref`, `window_ref`).
- `ProjectionReplayReceiptV1`: Signed durable receipt for replay-based
  reconstruction.
- `SourceTrustSnapshotV1` and `SinkIdentitySnapshotV1`: Authoritative and
  observed trust snapshots used for divergence and replay validation.
- `ReplaySequenceBoundsV1`: Required contiguous replay range contract.
- `ReconstructedProjectionState`: Deterministic replay output used to verify
  recovery correctness.
- `AuthorityKeyBindingV1`: Trusted signer binding used to validate replay
  receipts.

### Core Controls (RFC-0028 REQ-0009)

- Detect projection divergence against expected CAS+ledger-derived digests.
- Quarantine compromised channels without mutating authoritative trust roots.
- Require signed temporal authority references for compromise decisions.
- Reconstruct projection state from trusted, ordered, signature-verified
  receipts.

### Security Invariants (TCK-00469)

- [INV-PC-001] All cryptographic digest comparisons (expected vs. observed,
  temporal authority refs, window refs, source/sink snapshot digests) use
  `subtle::ConstantTimeEq::ct_eq()` to prevent timing side-channel leakage.
  Variable-time `==`/`!=` on `[u8; 32]` hash values is prohibited in this
  module.
