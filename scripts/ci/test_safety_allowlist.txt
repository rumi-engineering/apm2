# Test Safety Guard allowlist entries.
#
# Format:
#   RULE_ID|path
#   RULE_ID|path:line
#   *|path
#   *|path:line
#   RULE_ID|re:<bash-regex>
#
# Notes:
# - `RULE_ID` values come from scripts/ci/test_safety_guard.sh.
# - `*` matches every rule.
# - Regex entries are matched against:
#     RULE_ID|path:line|line_text
# - Keep entries as narrow as possible to preserve fail-closed behavior.
