# Regression fixture for evidence_refs_lint.sh
# This YAML file simulates an evidence artifact where "REQ-FAKE9999"
# appears in narrative text OUTSIDE the requirement_ids block.
# The lint MUST NOT treat the narrative token as a real requirement reference.

  id: EVID-FIXTURE-0001
  title: "Regression test for narrative token scope"
  requirement_ids:
    - "REQ-0101"
  description: |
    This evidence artifact was created for regression testing.
    It mentions REQ-FAKE9999 in its narrative description, but that
    reference is NOT a real requirement_id and should not be parsed
    as one by the evidence_refs_lint.sh script.
  status: VALIDATED
  notes: |
    Additional notes referencing REQ-FAKE9999 and EVID-FAKE8888
    that should also be ignored by the lint.
