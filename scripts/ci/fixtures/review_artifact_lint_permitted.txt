# Regression fixture for review_artifact_lint.sh (detect_direct_status_write)
# Each non-comment line below is a pattern that MUST NOT be detected as a violation.
# The test_lint_fixtures.sh script verifies these are all permitted.
#
# NOTE: With the allowlist/prohibition approach (TCK-00409 hardening), "gh api"
# calls are now forbidden at the per-line level.  The only permitted patterns are
# non-API commands and the blessed apm2 fac path.

# Permitted: plain comment (not a status write, not an API call)
gh pr comment $PR_URL --body-file findings.md

# Permitted: apm2 fac path for reviews
apm2 fac review dispatch 123 --type security

# Permitted: reading a file (no API call)
cat documents/reviews/SECURITY_REVIEW_PROMPT.md

# Permitted: apm2 fac review (generic review command)
apm2 fac review --pr 123 --type code-quality

# Permitted: echo/log statements mentioning status concepts (no API call)
echo "Review status set via FAC"
